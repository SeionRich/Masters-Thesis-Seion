Target catch - the main species which are sought after by a particular fishery e.g. cod or shrimp. Incidental catch - the species caught which are retained for consumption or marketing purposes. Discarded catch - the section of catch returned to the sea, usually dead or alive. Bycatch - Discarded catch combined with incidental catch. Fishery observer - is a specialist trained in collecting data onboard commercial fishing vessels. Observer data - data collected at-sea by fishery observers. Tow - The act of fishing or trawling. CPUE - Catch per unit effort i.e. the fish caught per unit of fishing effort e.g. kgs/hr. 1.2 Introduction The data used in this project is on discarded fish species (Appendix 5.2) from the Atlantic seabob (Appendix 5.3) fishery in Guyana, South America (Figure 1.1). The data was collected at-sea by fishery observers (Figure 1.2) onboard seven Atlantic seabob shrimp bottom trawl vessels (Appendix 5.1) between 2019 to 2020 (see chapter 1.3 for data variables). The data was collected within the seabob trawling zone i.e. 15 to 33 metres of water depth (Figure 1.1). It includes sampled bottom trawl fishing tow data from eight distinct fishing trips (one vessel was used twice) with an average of six sampled hauls per trip (three day, three night) and at different fishing depths (shallow, deep). Time of day are split into day (6:00HRS to 17:59HRS) and night (18:00HRS to 5:59HRS). Fishing depths are split into deep (&gt; 16.46 metres) and shallow (&lt;= 16.46 metres) of water depths. Based on interactions with fisherfolks in Guyana, discarding of fish species from Guyana`s main shrimp fishery is said to be excessive. Therefore this issue will be closely examined in this project, with specific emphasis on species weights and lengths; across varying time of day and fishing depths. All functions and function arguments in this project are followed directly by parenthesis i.e. (). So for example: filter() means filter() function and sum() means sum() function. Therefore the word function will not be used but is implied. To not be repetitive and to make the codes more readable: code comments will only be made the first time that the code is used. Code comments are placed after each object produced from a code chunk. Two examples of these objects are tables or figures. 1.2.1 Fishing Area Figure 1.1: Map of Guyana`s 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Yellow boundary lines represents the different maritime boundary zones. The Atlantic seabob fishing zone (i.e. 15 to 33 meter lines) is represented by the area shaded in red (Richardson, 2020). 1.2.2 Sampling protocol used to collect data Figure 1.2: Data collection sampling protocol used to collect the data for this project 1.3 Data manipulation R packages used in this project library(tidyverse) #[1].

From the output created above we can see that of the 32 variables, 17 were of class characters, 3 difftime and 12 numeric. All the data seems to fit reasonably well into the required categories i.e. character, difftime and numeric. The main exceptions were the dates variables. Normally, these would have needed to be converted before use. However, this will not be done in this project as dates are not required to answer the research questions. Description of data variables The variables within the data are coded. A total of 32 variables were recorded in the data. A description for each variable is below : company: Fishing company dep_date: Date the vessel departs port for fishing arr_date: Date the vessel returns from fishing das: Number of days the vessel spent at-sea trip: Unique trip identification number drag: Unique drag identification number by drag_all: Sequential drag identification number drag_date: Date the drag was done day: Day the drag was done month: Month the drag was done year: Year the drag was done zone: Fishing zone (Figure 1) where the drag was done drag_period: Binary variable of time of day for drag drag_time_s: Time the drag started (24:00 hrs) drag_time_e: Time the drag ended (24:00 hrs) time_fished_min: Time fished in hours hrs_dec: Time fished converted to decimals depth: Average fishing depth depth_sd: Binary variable of fishing depth id_status: Binary variable of species identification com_status: Binary variable of species economic status order: Species taxonomy - Order family: Species taxonomy - Family class: Species taxonomy - Class total_catch_cat: Catch categorization (see definitions) total_catch_spp: Board species categorization categories: More narrow species categorization sci_name: Latin names for each species alpha_code: Unique 3-alpha species identifier used by FAO com_name: Local name or call name for species sample_wt_lbs: Species sample weight per drag (in lbs) total_wt_lbs: Species total weight per drag (in lbs) However, most of them will not be required in this project.

All of the comments in this code are similar to that of &quot;Table.1.2&quot; except that # Fishing depth (i.e. &quot;FishingDepth2&quot;) has replaced &quot;TimePeriods&quot;. Here we see that data is across eight fishing trips. The samples were randomly collected across Deep and Shallow water depths. The number of samples collected ranged from 41 (Trip 3 - Shallow) to 177 (Trip 6 - Shallow) with the mean number sampled being 98. After reviewing the data we now look at the research objective, questions and hypotheses 1.5 Objective To determine the extent of discarding within Guyana`s Atlantic seabob shrimp fishery. This will be done using observer data to evaluate the weights and lengths of the discarded species across dissimilar time of day (day, night) and fishing depths (deep, shallow). More precisely this study will aim to answer the following questions: 1.5.1 Research Questions 1.5.1.1 First Submission What are the weights by the different catch categories and what proportions of the catch are discarded? What are the species discarded, their relative sampling proportions and weights? 1.5.1.2 Second Submission What are the weight distributions of the most common (by weight) discarded fish species across time of day and fishing depths? Are the mean weights for the discarded fish species (ALL) equal across time of day and fishing depths? 1.5.1.3 Third Submission (Joining Weights and Lengths data) What were the length distributions of the most common (by lengths) discarded fish species across time of day and fishing depths? Are the mean lengths for the discarded fish species (ALL) equal across time of day and fishing depths? 1.5.2 Hypotheses \\(H_O\\) (Null hypothesis)  Mean species weights are equal across time of day and fishing depths. \\(H_A\\) (Alternate hypothesis) - Mean species weights are not equal across time of day and fishing depths. \\(H_O\\) (Null hypothesis)  Mean species lengths are equal across time of day and fishing depths. \\(H_A\\) (Alternate hypothesis)  Mean species lengths are not equal across time of day and fishing depths.

Here the Observerdata is used to get the four categories of species caught and to plot # them using using four bar plots on a single window using facet_wrap(). #[2]. The first argument to ggplot() is the data (&quot;ObserverData&quot;). Then the mapping = aes() where # the X variable (&quot;TripID&quot;) and the Y variable &quot;TotalWeightKG&quot; were supplied. #[3]. The fill argument is used to colour the data by the different categories i.e. &quot;SpeciesCategory2&quot;. #[4]. The arguments were passed to geom_bar(). #[5]. The plot is formatted using theme() and the legend removed using the legend.position argument. # Because the names were provide by facet_wrap() a legend would have been redundant. #[6]. X and Y axis labels were added using labs(). #[7]. The scale_fill_brewer is used to customize the color of the bars according to the # species category. The palette argument is used within the function to achieve this. #[8]. facet_wrap() is used to complete the figure. In total 18,608 kgs of fish were landed. Of this amount, bony fish accounted for the highest i.e. 8,804 kgs, followed by shellfish (7,240 kgs), flatfish (1,938 kgs) and others (626 kgs) (Figure 2.1). A similar trend is seen in the mean weights caught per trip for the different categories i.e. bony fish the highest 1,101 kgs/trip, followed by shell fish (905 kgs/trip), flat fish 242 kgs/trip and Others 78 kgs/trip. The minimum and maximum discard landed by category are as follows: bony fish discards ranged from 683 kgs (trip 4) to 2,410 kgs (trip 6), shell fish from 346 kgs (trip 7) to 1,885 kgs (trip 4), flat fish from 18 kgs (trip 1) to 577 kgs (trip 6) and others from 9 kgs to 257 kgs (trip 6) (Figure 2.1). Now we will look at the proportions of the catch discarded 2.1.2 Proportions of the catch discarded This will be looked at across fishing trips FilteredCatch &lt;- ObserverData %&gt;% filter(CatchCategory == &quot;Discarded catch&quot; | CatchCategory == &quot;Target catch&quot;) SumFilteredCatch &lt;- FilteredCatch %&gt;% group_by(TripID, SpeciesCategory) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(WeightKG = sum(TotalWeightKG), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) %&gt;% group_by(TripID) %&gt;% mutate(Percentage = round(prop.table(WeightKG)*100)) ggplot(data = SumFilteredCatch, mapping = aes(x = SpeciesCategory, y = Percentage, fill = SpeciesCategory)) + geom_col(position = &quot;dodge&quot;, width = 0.9) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, colour = &quot;grey50&quot;), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + labs(x=&quot;Fishing Trips&quot;, y = &quot;Percentages (%)&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Set2&quot;, name = &quot; &quot;, labels = c(&quot;Discarded catch&quot;, &quot;Target catch&quot;)) + facet_grid(cols = vars(TripID)) Figure 2.2: Barplot showing a breakdown of weights (proportions) by catch category for the different fishing trips. The numbers at the top of each pair of bars i.e. in the grey area represents the Fishing Trip number ID ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. Filtering the observer data by catch category. #[2]. Creating a summary table of weights by fishing trip and species category. #[3]. group_by() and summarise() are used to obtain this along with sum() to create a # variable called &quot;WeightKG&quot;. #[4]. A new variable containing percentages for the different catch categories by # fishing trips is created using the prop.table() from base R. The values were rounded and # multiplied by 100 to convert to percentage. #[5]. The differences here is that geom_col() is used here in the place of geom_bar(). # This is used to allow &quot;position&quot; dodge argument which places the catch bars # side-by-side for easy comparison. #[6]. theme() arguments are similar to &quot;Plot1&quot;. The only additions are that the X axis ticks # and texts were removed using the arguments: axis.ticks.x and axis.text.x, with the # function value element_blank(). #[7]. The scale_fill_brewer is used to customize the color of the bars according to the catch category. # The palette argument is used within the function to achieve this. The names argument is used # to remove the default name and replace with a blank space (&quot; &quot;) and the labels argument # to add labels to the plot. #[8]. fact_grid() is used to present the data side-by-side by fishing trips. Of the total fish weight, discarded catch accounted for 11,956 kgs (68%) and target species 5,705 kgs (32%) (Figure 2.2). Discarded catch proportions (by weight) within the total catch ranged from 37% (trip 4) to 95% (trip 6). Target catch on the other hand ranged from 5% (trip 6) to 63% (trip 4) (Figure 2.2). 2.1.3 Assessment summary The data comprised of four different catch categories: bony fish, shell fish, flat fish and others. From the analysis done bony fish accounted to the highest total weights within the data and least was recorded by the others category. Discarding of fish species was found to relatively high (i.e. 68%) when compared to that of the target catch (32%). With the exception of fishing trip 1 and 4, the total weights of the discarded fish species was always higher than that of the target catch. 2.2 Research Question 2 What are the species discarded, their relative sampling proportions and weights? 2.2.1 Species discarded and their relative sampling proportions Table.2.1 &lt;- DiscardData %&gt;% group_by(OrderTax, FamilyTax, LatinNames) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(n = n(), prop = round(n/48,2), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) %&gt;% arrange(OrderTax) Table.2.1$OrderTax = ifelse(duplicated(Table.2.1$OrderTax), &quot;&quot;, Table.2.1$OrderTax) Table.2.1$FamilyTax = ifelse(duplicated(Table.2.1$FamilyTax), &quot;&quot;, Table.2.1$FamilyTax) Table.2.1 %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;Fish taxa identified from the 48 bottom trawl fishing tows sampled off the coast of Guyana.

All comments here are similar to &quot;Table.1.2&quot; In total, 61 fish taxa (i.e. excluding Scyphozoa sp. and Un id) were identified (Table 2.1), belonging to 39 families in 21 orders, with Perciformes (22 species) being the dominant order. Samples contained between 11 and 31 fish species, with an average of 21 ± 4 species per sample. Four species; Callinectes ornatus, Macrodon ancylodon, Stellifer microps and Stellifer rastrifer were the only species present in more than 95% (45) of the bottom trawl hauls.

Ranking is done from the highest (top of plot) to the lowest (bottom of plot). Six values above 100 kgs were removed to allow for better visulisation of trends in the species weight distributions. ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. First the main data &quot;DiscardData&quot; is filtered to remove species that occurred less than # five time in sample. This is done using group_by() and filter() from the dplyr package. # This is done to get meaning summary statistics e.g. median and range. # The new data is named &quot;SpeciesWeights&quot;. # [2]. The first argument to ggplot() is the data (&quot;SpeciesWeights&quot;). # But first separate() was used to split the LatinNames variables by Genus and Species. After this # the glue() function was used to italicize the names for plotting. # Then the mapping = aes() where the X variable (&quot;LatinNames&quot;) and the Y variable &quot;TotalWeightKG&quot; # were supplied. reorder() is used to sort the species from the highest(top of plot) # to the lowest (bottom of plot) median values. #[3]. The arguments were passed to geom_boxplot(). #[4]. coord_flip() is used to switch the axis to allow for a better presentation of # the data. This is due to the excess species. #[5]. X and Y axis labels were added using labs(). #[6]. The plot is formatted using theme() and the legend removed using the legend.position argument. The data presented in this paragraph and the figure above is filtered to remove those species which occurred less than 5 times in the sample (Figure 2.3). The top five species by median weight landed were: Polymixia lowei (18 kgs), followed by Stellifer rastrifer, Stellifer microps, Macrodon ancylodon and Larimus breviceps all with 14 kgs, respectively. The weight range for these species are as follows: Polymixia lowei (7 to 21 kgs), Stellifer rastrifer (1 to 164 kgs), Stellifer microps (1 to 133 kgs), Macrodon ancylodon (1 to 74 kgs) and Larimus breviceps (1 to 61 kgs). The five species with the lowest median weights were: Mustelus higmani (1 kg), followed by Sphoeroides testudineus, Persephona lichtensteinii, Chaetodipterus faber and Hepatus gronovii all with 2 kgs. The weight range for these species are as follows: Mustelus higmani (0.2 to 33 kgs), followed by Sphoeroides testudineus (0.1 to 26 kgs), Persephona lichtensteinii (0.005 to 14 kgs), Chaetodipterus faber (0.01 to 21 kgs) and Hepatus gronovii (0.3 to 14 kgs) (Figure 2.3). 2.2.3 Assessment summary From the analysis it was found that 61 different species (i.e. those positively identified) were discarded (Table 2.1). Of this amount four of them: Callinectes ornatus, Macrodon ancylodon, Stellifer microps and Stellifer rastrifer were in at least 45 of the 48 total bottom trawl tows. The latter three fish species, along with Polymixia lowei and Larimus breviceps were the most dominant species discarded by median weights.

The name of the table object is Table.3.1 #[2]. group_by() is used to group the data by Latin Names. #[3]. summarise() is called directly from the dplyr package using the command &quot;package name::function&quot; # due to clashes with other loaded R packages. #[3.1]. summarise() is then used to create a new variable called &quot;Weight.kg&quot;. &quot;Weight.kg&quot; # contains the summed weights for each discarded fish species. #[3.2]. The &quot;.group&quot; argument is used to control the grouping structure of the output, which # in this case it was dropped. #[4]. mutate() from the dplyr package is used to create a variable: &quot;Weight.pct&quot; i.e. Short for # weight percentage. #[4.1]. Strangely I was not getting percentage to add up to 100% when I used the formula # (Weight.kg/sum(Weight.kg)*100), so instead I did it manually. #[4.2]. &quot;Weight.pct&quot; was rounded to 2 decimal places using round(). #[5]. The table is sorted by the &quot;Weight&quot; variable in descending order using arrange(desc()). #[6]. head() is used to select the first 31 rows/fish species. #[7]. filter() is used to remove &quot;Un id&quot; which refers to multiple fish species that were unidentified # and not a single fish species. #[8]. kbl() from the kableExtra package is used as the primary formatting source for &quot;Table.3.1&quot; to # solve the auto format setting in a better way. #[9]. kable_classic() is used to set the theme. #[10]. row_spec() is used to select and bold the column texts. #[11]. kable_styling() is used to freeze the table headers and to adjust the theme and appearance of &quot;Table.3.1&quot;. The total weight of the 30 fish species examined in Table 3.1. was 10,055 kgs. From the table we see that three fish species only: Stellifer rastrifer(17.25 %), Stellifer microps(14.33 %) and Macrodon ancylodon (12.20) were responsible for (43.78 %) of total weight. These fish species individually accounted for more than 10% of the weights. This is quite substantial consider that they collectively were just 10 % of all the fish species examined. Some of the other more common fish species by weight discarded were Cynoscion virescens(6.34 %), Trichiurus lepturus(4.67 %), Nebris microps(4.08 %), Lonchurus elegans(4.07 %), Bagre bagre(3.74 %), Dasyatis geijskesi(3.62 %) and Symphurus plagusia(3.55 %). 3.1.2 Subsetting the top 6 most common fish species by weight Inspection of the data before analysis # Creating a vector Top.6.fish.names &lt;- head(Table.3.1$LatinNames, 6) # Filtering data Top.6.fish.data &lt;- DiscardData %&gt;% filter(LatinNames %in% Top.6.fish.names) # Plotting data ggplot(data = Top.6.fish.data, mapping = aes(x = DragID2, y = TotalWeightKG)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 1, to = 48)) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), text = element_text(size = 10), legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.text = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) + labs(x = &quot;Bottom trawl fishing tows&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kgs)&quot;) + ## the code below are used to add the max and min values to plot geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(TotalWeightKG == max(TotalWeightKG), paste0(&quot;Max = &quot;,round(TotalWeightKG, 3)), &quot;&quot;)), hjust = -0.5, size = 3, color = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(TotalWeightKG == min(TotalWeightKG), paste0(&quot;Min = &quot;, round(TotalWeightKG, 3)), &quot;&quot;)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3, color = &quot;red&quot;) + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = aes(label = &quot;&quot;))) Figure 3.1: Scatter plot of discarded fish species weights across bottom trawl fishing tows. A total of 48 bottom trawl fishing tows were made. Most of the weight observations are below 125 kgs ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. The vector &quot;Top.6.fish.names&quot; is created using head(). The fish species names were # extracted from the &quot;Table.3.1&quot; object. #[2]. The &quot;DiscardData&quot; data is subsetted to remove the observations for the top 6 fish species. # The new object is called &quot;Top.6.fish.data&quot;. This is done using filter(). #[3]. The first argument to ggplot() is the new data &quot;Top.6.fish.data&quot;. #[3.1]. The x-variable &quot;DragID2&quot; and the y-variable &quot;TotalWeightKG&quot; are supplied to mapping = aes(). #[4]. The arguments are passed to geom_point(). Transparency of the points were set at &quot;0.5&quot; using alpha(). # This makes the over-plotted points more visible. geom_jitter() was another option but the points # in this case was not many. #[5]. The plot theme is set with theme_bw(). #[6]. The x and y labels are added using labs(). After seeing the top 30 fish species by weight in Table 3.1 we will now zoom in on the top 6 fish species. Before any analysis it is important to inspect the data visually. From the scatter plot (Figure 3.1), we see that for the 48 bottom trawl fishing tows conducted, the weights ranged between 0.018 kgs to 219.586 kgs. Despite this range most of the points were below 125 kgs. This means that a few data points were abnormally high. These points are highlighted below and will subsequently be removed from the analysis, as they were probably mistakes. This decision was guided by my knowledge about the data.

The &quot;Top.6.fish.data&quot; data is subsetted to remove the outlier observations. The new object # is called &quot;Outliers&quot;. This is done using filter(). #[2]. The comments for the code used to produce Figure 3.2 is similar to that for Figure 3.1, # except for the following: #[2.1]. geom_point() was used twice with the two different data. The second data &quot;Outliers&quot; was used with # size() and color() arguments to make the outliers visible. #[2.2]. legend.position() argument was used in theme() to show the legend to the bottom. #[2.3]. The name of the legend was specified using guides(). From Figure 3.2 we see that there were three abnormally high data points. These were for discarded fish species Trichiurus lepturus(219.586 kgs), Stellifer rastrifer(163.973 kgs) and Stellifer microps(132.773 kgs). As mentioned before these points are strangely high and therefore are perceived to be incorrectly entered and thus will be omitted from the analysis. From the Figure we also see that the minimum weight was 0.018 kgs and the new maximum will be 107.599 kgs. 3.1.3 Assessment of fish species weights across time of day 3.1.3.1 Box plots of the distribution for the six (6) most common (by weights) fish species discarded across time of day. # Removing the outliers Top.6.fish.data &lt;- Top.6.fish.data %&gt;% filter(TotalWeightKG &lt; 125) # Plotting data ggplot(Top.6.fish.data, aes(x = LatinNames, y = TotalWeightKG, colour = LatinNames)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) + stat_boxplot(geom = &#39;errorbar&#39;, width = 0.2) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, colour = &quot;grey50&quot;), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.text = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) + labs(x = &quot;Latin names of fish species&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kgs)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~TimePeriods, ncol = 2) Figure 3.3: Boxplot of discarded fish species weights by time of day.

To see a description of the functions used in this code and how they work please refer # to the code comments made at Table.3.1 Of the total discard fish species weights (5,403 kgs) for the top 6 fish species, 52% (2,835 kgs) were recorded for the day and 48% (2,568 kgs) for the night (Table 3.2). This means that the cumulative fish species weights were marginally higher in the day when compared to the night. Further, we see that the total weights by fish species in the day ranged from 170 kgs(Nebris microps) to 765 kgs(Stellifer rastrifer). Whereas the total weights in the night ranged from 54 kgs (Trichiurus lepturus) to 806 kgs (Stellifer rastrifer). From Figure 3.3 and Table 3.2 we see that Trichiurus lepturus had the lowest median weights across time of day i.e. 4 kgs (day) and 1 kg (night) for the top 6 fish species examined. While Stellifer rastrifer recorded the highest median weights for both the day (37 kgs) and night (30 kgs). Therefore, we can conclude that Stellifer rastrifer was the most dominant discarded fish species across time of day with the highest individual total weight and median, while Nebris microps and Trichiurus lepturus were the least dominant discarded fish species i.e. recording the lowest total weight and median, respectively, across time of day. 3.1.4 Assessment of fish species weights across fishing depths 3.1.4.1 Box plots of the distribution for the six (6) most common (by weights) fish species discarded across fishing depths. ggplot(Top.6.fish.data, aes(x = LatinNames, y = TotalWeightKG, colour = LatinNames)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) + stat_boxplot(geom = &#39;errorbar&#39;, width = 0.2) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, colour = &quot;grey50&quot;), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.text = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) + labs(x = &quot;Latin names of fish species&quot;, y = &quot;Weights (kgs)&quot;) + facet_wrap(.~FishingDepth2) Figure 3.4: Boxplot of discarded fish species weights by fishing depths.

To see a description of the functions used in this code and how they work please refer # to the code comments made at Table.3.1 Of the total discard fish species weights (5,403 kgs) for the top 6 fish species, 48% (2,574 kgs) were recorded for the deep and 52% (2,829 kgs) for the shallow (Table 3.3). This means that the cumulative fish species weights were marginally higher in the shallow when compared to the deep. Further, we see that the total weights by fish species in the deep ranged from 91 kgs(Trichiurus lepturus) to 689 kgs(Stellifer rastrifer). Whereas the total weights in the shallow ranged from 159 kgs (Trichiurus lepturus) to 882 kgs (Stellifer rastrifer). From Figure 3.4 and Table 3.3 we see that Trichiurus lepturus had the lowest median weights across fishing depths i.e. 2 kgs (deep) and 4 kgs (shallow) for the top 6 fish species examined. While Stellifer rastrifer recorded the highest median weights for both the deep (30 kgs) and shallow (34 kgs). Therefore, we can conclude that Stellifer rastrifer was the most dominant discarded fish species across fishing depths with the highest total wight and median, while Trichiurus lepturus was the least dominant discarded fish species i.e. recording the lowest total weight and median across fishing depths. 3.1.5 Assessment summary In summary, of the top 6 species examined across time of day and fishing depths we found that Stellifer rastrifer was always the main discarded species whereas Trichiurus lepturus was often the least discarded species amongst the top six species looked at. 3.2 Research Question 4 Are the mean weights for the discarded fish species (ALL) equal across time of day and fishing depths? To answer this research question we will now look at the discarded fish species - weight data for all fish species. This will help us to get an idea of how weights are distributed for the entire population and not just a subsample of the data which we used to answer Research Question 3. The following hypothesis will be tested \\(H_O\\) (Null hypothesis)  Mean species weights are equal across time of day and fishing depths. \\(H_A\\) (Alternate hypothesis) - Mean species weights are not equal across time of day and fishing depths.

Colours used to represent the different time of day ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. The code comments made in the earlier Tables and Figures mostly apply here too except that: #[2]. log10() is used to transform the weight data to a log scale in the &quot;Mean.TP.2&quot; object. # This was done to create the vertical line (using geom_vline()) of the group # means in Figure 3.6. #[3]. fill() is passed to mapping = aes() to group and color the data by time of day. #[4]. scale_x_continuous() is used with the &quot;trans&quot; argument to log transform the data to the base 10. #[5]. geom_vline() is used to add vertical lines showing the &quot;mean weights&quot; by time of day on the # density plots. These are highlighted by the arguments color, linetype and size. #[6]. Otherwise, please see code comments made at &quot;Table.3.1&quot;, &quot;Figure 3.3&quot; and the other # Tables and Figures in this submission. From the density plot shown in Figure 3.7 we can see that the data is skewed to the right. The reason for this is that the data is recorded by fish species observations and usually the very small fish species are discarded. The weights for all fish species ranged from 0.005 kgs to 100 kgs in the day and 0.005 kgs to 108 kgs in the night. The mean weight for all fish species was higher in the day (9.37 kgs) in comparison to the night (8.53 kgs). To better see these distributions the data was log transformed and presented in Figure 3.8. From this plot we can see the weight distribution clearer, hence log transforming the data worked reasonably fine. 3.2.1.2 Fishing depths # Summary table - fishing depths Mean.FD.1 &lt;- Discard.data %&gt;% group_by(FishingDepth2) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(MeanWeight = mean(TotalWeightKG), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) # Initial plot - fishing depths ggplot(Discard.data, aes(TotalWeightKG, color = FishingDepth2, fill = FishingDepth2)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.1) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10), axis.title = element_text(size = 10), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Weights (Log Scale)&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) + geom_vline(data = Mean.FD.1, aes(xintercept = MeanWeight, color = FishingDepth2), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;, size = 0.5) Figure 3.9: Density plot of discarded fish species weight-distribution by fishing depths.

Colours used to represent the different fishing depths ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. To see a description of what the functions in these code are doing please refer to # the code comments made at Figures 3.7 and 3.8 and in the Mean.TP.1 and Mean.TP.2 tables. # The only exception is that &quot;TimePeriods&quot; i.e. time of day, is replaced with # &quot;FishingDepth2&quot; i.e. fishing depths. From the density plot shown in Figure 3.9 we can see that the data is again skewed to the right. The reason for this is the same i.e. that the data is recorded by fish species observations and usually the very small fish species are discarded. The weights for all fish species ranged from 0.005 kgs to 87 kgs in the deep and 0.005 kgs to 108 kgs in the shallow. The mean weight for all fish species was higher in the deep (9.16 kgs) in comparison to the shallow (8.80 kgs). To better see these distributions the data was log transformed and presented in Figure 3.10. From this plot we can see the weight distribution clearer, hence log transforming the data worked reasonably fine. 3.2.2 Analysis of the mean weights for discarded fish species across time of day and fishing depths using the Welch Two Sample t-test. Test assumptions This test assumes that the the weight observations across time of day (day/night) and fishing depths (deep/shallow) are normally distributed. Fortunately as well, this method is not at all sensitive to deviations from this assumption. Therefore, if the distributions of day/night or deep/shallow are the same e.g. if both distributions are skewed to the right. This example is the case with this data as seen earlier. This means that the analysis will be performed on the actual weights variable and no transformation is needed. This assumption was tested in this project and the results indeed were almost identical How the Welch Two Sample t-test works The test statistic, \\(t_s\\), is computed using a method that has the difference between the means in the numerator. This therefore makes the \\(t_s\\) larger as the means move away from each other. The standard error of the difference in the means in this case is denominator. This value decreases as the sample variances decreases or if the size of sample increase. Hence the \\(t_s\\) gets larger as the means move further apart, the variances get smaller, or if the size of the sample increase. The probability of getting the observed \\(t_s\\) value under the null hypothesis is computed using the t-distribution. Conducting the t-tests 3.2.2.1 Time of day # Welch t.test - time of day Weight.ttest.TP &lt;- t.test(TotalWeightKG ~ TimePeriods, data = Discard.data) Weight.ttest.TP Welch Two Sample t-test data: TotalWeightKG by TimePeriods t = 0.89664, df = 1056.3, p-value = 0.3701 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.9953903 2.6705615 sample estimates: mean in group Day mean in group Night 9.370018 8.532433 ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. The &quot;DiscardData&quot; is passed to t.test(). #[2]. t.test() is used to analyze the &quot;TotalWeightKG&quot; variable against time of day. The p-value associated with the test is \\(0.37\\), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) of no difference between the (true) means of the two groups (i.e. time of day; day and night) since the p-value is greater than the usual significance level \\(alpha = 0.05\\). Therefore we conclude based on this data, that there is not enough evidence of a difference between the (true) means of the two groups at the usual significance level of \\(alpha = 0.05\\). 3.2.2.2 Fishing depths # Welch t.test - fishing depths Weight.ttest.FD &lt;- t.test(TotalWeightKG ~ FishingDepth2, data = Discard.data) Weight.ttest.FD Welch Two Sample t-test data: TotalWeightKG by FishingDepth2 t = 0.39181, df = 1050.8, p-value = 0.6953 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -1.461899 2.191380 sample estimates: mean in group Deep mean in group Shallow 9.163561 8.798821 ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. To see a description of what the functions in this code are doing please refer to # the code comments at Weight.ttest.TP. The only exception is &quot;FishingDepth2&quot; # have replaced &quot;TimePeriods&quot;. The p-value associated with the test is \\(0.70\\), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) of no difference between the (true) means of the two groups (i.e. fishing depths; deep and shallow) since the p-value is greater than the usual significance level \\(alpha = 0.05\\). Therefore we conclude based on this data, that there is not enough evidence of a difference between the (true) means of the two groups at the usual significance level of \\(alpha = 0.05\\). 3.2.3 Analysis summary In summary, from the analysis of the discarded species (ALL) from the data, we found that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) which is that the means are equal across time of day and fishing depths. This was proven by the high p-values (\\(&gt; 0.05\\)) obtained from the Welch Two Sample t-tests conducted on the discard species data across time of day and fishing depths. 3.3 Closing remarks Chapter 3 was focused on the weight analysis of discarded fish species. In Chapter 4, the focus will shift to the length analysis of discarded fish species. To achieve this a separate dataset will be joined to the data which was used in this Chapter. This will be required to answer Research Questions 5 &amp; 6. For more details please see Chapter 1 - sub-chapter 1.5. "],["chapter-3.html", "4 CHAPTER 4.1 Research Question 5 4.2 Research Question 6 4.3 Final remarks", " 4 CHAPTER 4.1 Research Question 5 What were the length distributions of the most common species (by lengths measured) discarded across time of day and fishing depths? 4.1.1 Length distributions of the discarded fish species Importing and joining data # Reading in length data into R LengthImport &lt;- read_csv(&quot;observer_lengths_mas102m.csv&quot;) # Joining data. But only keeping the rows containing length measurements for this # part of the analysis.

This was so because species measurements were only done whenever a given species presence within a given sample was 30 or more. Initially, the analysis in this chapter will zero in on the length measurements for the more common fish species measured (by count) to answer Research Question 5 whereas ALL fish species from the data will be utilized in answering Research Question 6. However before sub-setting the data here is a view of length measurements for ALL of the fish species measured # Creating species length table Table.4.1 &lt;- LengthData %&gt;% group_by(LatinNames) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(NoMeasured = n(), MeanLength = round(mean(Lengths)), MedianLength = round(median(Lengths)), SDLength = round(sd(Lengths)), MaxLength = round(max(Lengths)), MinLength = round(min(Lengths)), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) %&gt;% arrange(desc(NoMeasured)) # Printing table Table.4.1 %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;All fish species length measurements with summary statistics.

Of this amount Stellifer rastrifer (989), Stellifer microps (718), Macrodon ancylodon (480), Nebris microps (262), Bagre bagre (239) and Cynoscion virescens (215) were the six most common species measured (Table 4.1). These species collectively accounted for 2903 (83.5%) of the total discarded fish species measured. On the other hand, Trichiurus lepturus (30), Anchoa spinifer (30) and Larimus breviceps (62) were the least abundant. Fish species lengths ranged from a minimum of 2 cm (Stellifer rastrifer and Stellifer microps) to 70 cm (Trichiurus lepturus). The median lengths for all species except Trichiurus lepturus (60 cm) and Paralonchurus elegans (23 cm) were below 20 cm. 4.1.2 Subsetting the top 6 most common fish species measured After seeing the length distribution for the fish species measured (Table 4.1) we will now zoom in on the 6 most commonly measured. Before any analysis it is important to inspect the data visually.

A total of 48 bottom trawl fishing tows were made. No fish lengths were measured for 9 fishing trips; 12,22,24,28,30,40,43,44 &amp; 45. ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. To see a description of the functions used in this code and how they work please refer # to the code comments made at Figure 3.1 (Chapter 3). From the scatter plot (Figure 4.1), we see that from the 48 bottom trawl fishing tows conducted, no fish were measured for 9 (19 %) of the total fishing trips i.e. 12, 22, 24, 28, 30, 40, 43, 44 &amp; 45. Again, this was largely because length measurements were only done when individual species count exceeded 30. Of the top 6 fish species measured, all of the length observations are below 40 cm and they were mostly tightly distributed, which is usually a good signal. This means that none of the data points are abnormally high as was the case with the weight data (see Figure 3.1). The range for the length distribution is 2 cm to 38 cm. The mean and median length distribution were 12 cm each, which is good as well, as it is likely that the data is not skewed. 4.1.3 Assessment of the top 6 fish species lengths across time of day 4.1.3.1 Box plots of the length distributions for the six (6) most common (by amount measured) fish species discarded across time of day. # Plotting data ggplot(length.data.top.6, aes(x = LatinNames, y = Lengths, colour = LatinNames)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) + stat_boxplot(geom = &#39;errorbar&#39;, width = 0.2) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, colour = &quot;grey50&quot;), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.text = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) + labs(x = &quot;Latin names of fish species&quot;, y = &quot;Lengths (cm)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~TimePeriods, ncol = 2) Figure 4.2: Boxplot of discarded fish species lengths by time of day.

To see a description of the functions used in this code and how they work please refer # to the code comments made at Table 3.2 (Chapter 3). Of the total discarded fish species measured (2,903) for the top 6 fish species, 1,498 (52 %) are recorded for the day and 1,405 (48 %) for the night (Table 4.2). This means that the cumulative fish species measured are marginally higher in the day when compared to the night. Further, we see that the mean lengths by fish species in the day ranged from 9 cm (Stellifer rastrifer) to 17 cm (Cynoscion virescens). Whereas the mean lengths in the night ranged from 10 cm (Stellifer rastrifer and Bagre bagre) to 18 cm (Cynoscion virescens and Macrodon ancylodon). From Figure 4.2 and Table 4.2 we see that Bagre bagre had the lowest median lengths (9 cm) for the day (with Stellifer rastrifer) and night measurements, respectively i.e. for the top 6 fish species examined. While Cynoscion virescens and Macrodon ancylodon recorded the joint highest median lengths across time of day; day (17 cm) and night (18 cm). Therefore, we conclude that Cynoscion virescens and Macrodon ancylodon are the largest of the top six discarded fish species examined across time of day as they recorded the highest mean and median length measurements, while Stellifer rastrifer and Bagre bagre are the smallest i.e. recording the lowest mean and median lengths, respectively, across time of day. Next a similar species assessment will be done but the condition will change from time of day to now fishing depths 4.1.4 Assessment of fish species lengths across fishing depths 4.1.4.1 Box plot of the length distribution for the six (6) most common (by amount measured) fish species discarded across fishing depths. ggplot(data = length.data.top.6, aes(x = LatinNames, y = Lengths, colour = LatinNames)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) + stat_boxplot(geom = &#39;errorbar&#39;, width = 0.2) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, colour = &quot;grey50&quot;), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.text = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) + labs(x = &quot;Latin names of fish species&quot;, y = &quot;Lengths (cm)&quot;) + facet_wrap(.~FishingDepth2) Figure 4.3: Boxplot of discarded fish species lengths by fishing depths.

To see a description of the functions used in this code and how they work please refer # to the code comments made at Table.3.1 (Chapter 3) Of the total discarded fish species measured (2,903) for the top 6 fish species, 1,520 (52 %) are recorded for the deep and 1,383 (48 %) for the shallow Table 4.3. This means that the cumulative fish species measured are marginally higher in the deep when compared to the shallow. Further, we see that the mean lengths by fish species in the deep ranged from 9 cm (Stellifer rastrifer) to 18 cm (Cynoscion virescens). The range was the same for the shallow with Bagre bagre recording the minimum (9 cm) and once again Cynoscion virescens the maximum (18 cm). From Figure 4.3 and Table 4.3 we see that Stellifer rastrifer had the lowest median lengths (9 cm) for the deep and Bagre bagre (8 cm) for the shallow measurements, respectively. While Cynoscion virescens recorded the highest median lengths for the deep (17 cm) and the joint highest for the shallow (18 cm) i.e. together with Macrodon ancylodon. Therefore, we conclude that Cynoscion virescens and Macrodon ancylodon are the largest of the top six discarded fish species examined across fishing depths as they recorded the highest mean and median length measurements, while Stellifer rastrifer and Bagre bagre are the smallest i.e. recording the lowest mean and median lengths, respectively, across fishing depths. 4.1.5 Assessment summary In summary, of the top 6 species examined across time of day and fishing depths we found that Cynoscion virescens and Macrodon ancylodon were often the largest discarded species whereas Stellifer rastrifer and Bagre bagre were often the smallest discarded species. Four of the top six species measured (i.e. Macrodon ancylodon, Nebris microps, Bagre bagre and Cynoscion virescens are commercially viable to the Atlantic seabob and other local fisheries in Guyana. Despite most of the discarded species being juveniles (tiny) and below the common economic length for landing i.e. 25cm, there were some observations of the discarded fish species which were of marketable lengths. This finding was surprising and concerning. In my personal opinion discarding of fish of any size should be disincentivised/disallowed as it is a wastage of valuable marine resources. 4.2 Research Question 6 Are the mean lengths for the discarded fish species (ALL) equal across time of day and fishing depths? To answer this research question we will now look at the discard fish species - length data for all fish species. This will help us to get an idea of how the lengths are distributed for the entire population and not just a subsample of the data which we used to answer Research Question 5. The following hypothesis will be tested \\(H_O\\) (Null hypothesis)  Mean species lengths are equal across time of day and fishing depths. \\(H_A\\) (Alternate hypothesis) - Mean species lengths are not equal across time of day and fishing depths.

A total of 48 bottom trawl fishing tows were made. Most of the length observations are below 40 cm. Trichiurus lepturus was removed. ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. Please see the code comments made at Figure 3.1. From the scatter plot (Figure 4.4), we see that for the 48 bottom trawl fishing tows conducted, the lengths ranged between 2 cm to 70 cm. Despite this range most of the points were below 40 cm. The exceptional points are from a single fish species (Trichiurus lepturus) which generally grows large. This species was removed (Figure 4.5) so that we can better see the distribution. The data points (lengths) for each species seems tightly distributed, which is a good sign. With this confirmation, we can now go ahead with the data analysis. We will now visualize the length distributions using histograms 4.2.1 Length distribution for all discarded fish species, across time of day and fishing depths. 4.2.1.1 Time of day # Removing Trichiurus lepturus LengthData2 &lt;- LengthData %&gt;% filter(!LatinNames == &quot;Trichiurus lepturus&quot;) # Summary table - time of day mean.length.tp &lt;- LengthData2 %&gt;% group_by(TimePeriods) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(MeanLengths = mean(Lengths), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) # Initial plot - time of day ggplot(data = LengthData2, aes(Lengths, color = TimePeriods, fill = TimePeriods)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.1, bins = 20) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.justification = c(1,1.1), legend.position = c(0.99,1)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set2&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Lengths (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Counts&quot;) + geom_vline(data = mean.length.tp, aes(xintercept = MeanLengths, color = TimePeriods), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;, size = 0.5) Figure 4.6: Histogram of discarded fish species length-distribution by time of day. Colours used to represent the different time of day. To better see the distribution Trichiurus lepturus was removed Trichiurus lepturus was the largest discarded fish species with exceptional values (Figure 4.4), and therefore was temporarily removed from the data to allow for better visualization and interpretation of summary statistics. However the species will be included in later analysis. From the histogram shown in Figure 4.6 we can see that the data is reasonably normally distributed. The reason for the bell shape (the mean) being more oriented to the left of the plot is that discarded fish species are mostly small with only a few larger observations. The lengths for the fish species plotted ranged from 2 cm to 38 cm in the day and 2 cm to 31 cm in the night. The mean length for the discarded fish species is lower in the day (12.6 cm), in comparison to the night (13.0 cm). The standard deviations for the means are 5.3 cm (day) and 5.2 cm (night). We will now look at length distributions across fishing depths 4.2.1.2 Fishing depths # Summary table - fishing depths mean.length.fd &lt;- LengthData2 %&gt;% group_by(FishingDepth2) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(MeanLengths = mean(Lengths), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) # Initial plot - fishing depths ggplot(data = LengthData2, aes(Lengths, color = FishingDepth2, fill = FishingDepth2)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.1, bins = 20) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.justification = c(1,1.1), legend.position = c(0.99,1)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set2&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Lengths (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Counts&quot;) + geom_vline(data = mean.length.fd, aes(xintercept = MeanLengths, color = FishingDepth2), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;, size = 0.5) Figure 4.7: Histogram of discarded fish species length-distribution by fishing depths. Colours used to represent the different fishing depths. To better see the distribution Trichiurus lepturus was removed once again As a reminder once more, Trichiurus lepturus was temporarily removed. From the histogram shown in Figure 4.7 we can see that again the data is reasonably normally distributed. The reason for the bell shape (the mean) being more oriented to the left of the plot being the same as stated prior i.e. discarded fish species are mostly small with only a few larger observations. The lengths for the fish species plotted ranged from 2 cm to 38 cm in the deep and 3 cm to 31 cm in the shallow. The mean length for the discarded fish species is lower in the deep (12.4 cm), in comparison to the shallow (13.2 cm). The standard deviations for the means are 5.3 cm (deep) and 5.2 cm (shallow). Having viewed the data, we will now run some statistical tests to test the hypotheses 4.2.2 Analysis of the mean lengths for discarded fish species across time of day and fishing depths using the Welch Two Sample t-test. Test assumptions This test assumes that the the length observations across time of day (day/night) and fishing depths (deep/shallow) are normally distributed. Fortunately as well, this method is not at all sensitive to deviations from this assumption. Therefore, if the distributions of day/night or deep/shallow are the same e.g. if both distributions are skewed to the right/left. As seen from the histograms (Figures 4.6 and 4.7), the length distribution fits this expectation nicely. Therefore, the analysis will be performed on the actual length variable and no transformation will be required. As a precautionary measure, this assumption was also tested in chapter 3.2.2 and proven to be accurate How the Welch Two Sample t-test works The test statistic, \\(t_s\\), is computed using a method that has the difference between the means in the numerator. This therefore makes the \\(t_s\\) larger as the means move away from each other. The standard error of the difference in the means in this case is denominator. This value decreases as the sample variances decreases or if the size of sample increase. Hence the \\(t_s\\) gets larger as the means move further apart, the variances get smaller, or if the size of the sample increase. The probability of getting the observed \\(t_s\\) value under the null hypothesis is computed using the t-distribution. Conducting the t-tests 4.2.2.1 Time of day # Welch t.test - time of day length.ttest.tp &lt;- t.test(Lengths ~ TimePeriods, data = LengthData) length.ttest.tp Welch Two Sample t-test data: Lengths by TimePeriods t = 1.619, df = 3217.7, p-value = 0.1055 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.07743775 0.81125088 sample estimates: mean in group Day mean in group Night 13.40032 13.03342 ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1]. The &quot;LengthData&quot; is passed to t.test(). #[2]. t.test() is used to analyze the &quot;Lengths&quot; variable against time of day. The p-value associated with the test is \\(0.10\\), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) of no difference between the (true) means of the two groups (i.e. time of day; day and night) since the p-value is greater than the usual significance level \\(alpha = 0.05\\). Therefore we conclude based on this data, that there is not enough evidence of a difference between the (true) means of the two groups at the usual significance level of \\(alpha = 0.05\\). We now repeat the test for fishing depths 4.2.2.2 Fishing depths # Welch t.test - fishing depths length.ttest.fd &lt;- t.test(Lengths ~ FishingDepth2, data = LengthData) length.ttest.fd Welch Two Sample t-test data: Lengths by FishingDepth2 t = -7.022, df = 2997.8, p-value = 2.695e-12 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -2.073593 -1.168343 sample estimates: mean in group Deep mean in group Shallow 12.41628 14.03725 ### CODE COMMENTS ### #[1].

The only exception is &quot;FishingDepth2&quot; # have replaced &quot;TimePeriods&quot;. The p-value associated with the test is \\(2.695e-12\\), therefore we reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) of there being no difference between the (true) means of the two groups (i.e. fishing depths; deep and shallow) since the p-value is lesser than the usual significance level \\(alpha = 0.05\\). Therefore we conclude based on this data, that there is enough evidence of a difference between the (true) means of the two groups at the usual significance level of \\(alpha = 0.05\\). 4.2.3 Analysis summary In summary, from the analysis of the discarded species (ALL) across time of day, we found that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) of the means being equal across time of day. This was proven by the high p-value (\\(&gt; 0.05\\)) obtained from the Welch Two Sample t-tests conducted on the discarded species data across time of day. On the other hand, we did find (based on the data) that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) of the means being equal across fishing depths. This was proven by the low p-value (\\(&gt; 0.05\\)) obtained from the Welch Two Sample t-tests conducted on the discard species data across fishing depths. 4.3 Final remarks Chapter 4 was focused on a Length Analysis of the discarded fish species caught offshore Guyana. To achieve this a separate dataset LengthImport containing length measurements was Joined to the original data Discard.data used in Chapter 3 which contained the weight measurements for the Weight Analysis.
