# Abstract

**This is usually written last, but I am currently doing a course (Science Communication & Scientific Writing) where this was given as an assignment, so I include it as a draft.**

Anecdotal evidence suggested that discarding within Guyana`s main shrimp fishery is excessive and includes commercially viable juvenile species. For the first time unbiased data on discards were obtained by way of an At-sea Observer Program between 2019 to 2020. The observers sampled 48 fishing hauls across eight random fishing trips at an average of six fishing hauls per trip i.e. three days and nights, respectively. This study examined the dataset for the first time; with emphasis on species weights, rates, and lengths; across varying time-periods (days/nights) and fishing depths (≤ or > 9 fathoms). Where species count within the samples were copious, the assessment focused on the more common by weights, rates and lengths recorded. The composition of discards at the fishery level was also estimated using the observer data. The two-sample t-test were used to analyze the differences in mean species weights and sizes.The paired t-tests were used to analyze the differences in mean catch rates. In the 48 fishing hauls sampled, 70 fish taxa were identified from 36 families in 11 orders, with Perciformes (28 species) being the dominant order. Discards made up a substantial 40% of the total fishery biomass. Six of the more common species by weight (i.e. bangamary, butterfish, seatrout, rockhead, catfish and cuirass and butterfish) were of commercial importance and accounted for roughly 45% of the total biomass. The mean species weights (100 kg/trip), rates (60 kg/twin-net hour), and lengths recorded (15 cm) were significantly higher at nights and in shallow water conditions. These findings have significant economic and ecological implications on the sustainability of the fishery and therefore in the short term should influence management e.g. through improved policies and research.

# Introduction

**To be written.**

<br>

**I am doing the analysis in Rmarkdown, so I am integrating texts and codes as I go along.**

## Objective:

To determine the extent of discarding within Guyana`s main shrimp fishery by assessing discard composition, weights, rates, and lengths across dissimilar time-periods (day/night) and fishing depths (≤ or > 9 fathoms), using observer data. 

## Research questions:

1. What proportion of the total catch do discards account for?

2. What proportion of the discards are commercially viable species?                                                       

3. What are the species discarded and what are their relative weights and catch rates?                                        

4. Which species have the highest weights, catch rates and lengths?                                                     

5. What are the length distributions of the discarded bycatch species?                                                        

6. At which time-period and fishing depth is discarding most prevalent?                                                     

7. Does time-period significantly impact discard weights, catch rates and lengths?                                              

8. Does fishing depth significantly impact discard weights, catch rates and lengths?

# Data and Methods 

The data used was collected by at-sea observers onboard shrimp trawl vessels between 2019 to 2020. All samples were from within the seabob trawling zone i.e. the eight to eighteen fathoms - depth contour (see Figure 1). The data includes haul-by-haul records from eight fishing trips, with an average of six hauls per fishing trip i.e. three days and three nights, respectively. Fishing was carried out at different water depths i.e. ≤ and > 9 fathoms. In addition to these conditions, fishing locations and trawling speed were consistent with commercial fishing practices. Other key variables measured included the haul time (hrs.) and days-at-sea, among others. 

![Seabob trawling zone (8 and 18-fathom lines) within the EEZ. Modified from (Maison 2015).](C:\Users\UNUFTP\OneDrive - Háskóli Íslands\Haskoli files\University of Iceland\University of Iceland\First year\Semester 2\Courses\Thesis\Haskoli_project\Picture1.PNG)

Microsoft Excel and R statistical software were used for the data manipulation and analysis, respectively. The evaluations investigated discard proportionality in terms of weights, catch rates, lengths, and general composition. These were measured against time-periods and fishing locations where practicable. Parametric statistical testing was used as the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were satisfied. The two-sample was used to assess for significance in the differences in mean species weights (lbs.) and sizes (cm). The paired t-tests was used to assess for significance in the differences in mean catch rates (lbs./twin-trawl hr.).

**In the draft #2 I will add some structure to the report and will remove some of the excess tables and plots and add some others in accordance with the research questions. I also plan to commence writing up the sections as I go along. The plan is send weekly or bi-weekly updates of my progress.**
