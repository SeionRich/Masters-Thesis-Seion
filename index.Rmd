# Data

The data used in this project is on discarded fish species [(Appendix 12.2)][Discarded fish species] from the Atlantic seabob [(Appendix 12.3)][Atlantic seabob shrimp] fishery in Guyana, South America (Figure \@ref(fig:fig01)). The data was collected at-sea by fishery observers (Figure \@ref(fig:fig02)) onboard seven Atlantic seabob shrimp bottom trawl vessels [(Appendix 12.1)][Bottom trawl fishing vessel] between 2019 to 2020 (see chapter 1.3 for data variables). The data was collected within the seabob trawling zone i.e. 15 to 33 metres of water depth (Figure \@ref(fig:fig01)). It includes sampled bottom trawl fishing tow data from eight distinct fishing trips (one vessel was used twice) with an average of six sampled hauls per trip (three day, three night) and at different fishing depths.

```


**Inspecting the classes of variables**

```{r 0.3.1}
ObserverData %>% 
  glimpse()

### CODE COMMENTS ###
#[1]. glimpse() is used to view the classes of each variable from the data. 
```

From the output created above we can see that of the 32 variables, 17 were of class characters, 3 difftime and 12 numeric. All the data seems to fit reasonably well into the required categories i.e. character, difftime and numeric. The main exceptions were the dates variables. Normally, these would have needed to be converted before use. However, this will not be done in this project as dates are not required to answer the research questions. 

**Description of data variables**

The variables within the data are coded. A total of 32 variables were recorded in the data. A description for each variable is below : 

1. **company**: Fishing company
2. **dep_date**: Date the vessel departs port for fishing
3. **arr_date**: Date the vessel returns from fishing
4. **das**: Number of days the vessel spent at-sea       
5. **trip**: Unique trip identification number
6. **drag**: Unique drag identification number by 
7. **drag_all**: Sequential drag identification number 
8. **drag_date**: Date the drag was done
9. **day**: Day the drag was done
10. **month**: Month the drag was done
11. **year**: Year the drag was done
12. **zone**: Fishing zone (Figure 1) where the drag was done
13. **drag_period**: Binary variable of time of day for drag
14. **drag_time_s**: Time the drag started (24:00 hrs)
15. **drag_time_e**: Time the drag ended (24:00 hrs)
16. **time_fished_min**: Time fished in hours
17. **hrs_dec**: Time fished converted to decimals 
18. **depth**: Average fishing depth
19. **depth_sd**: Binary variable of fishing depth
20. **id_status**: Binary variable of species identification
21. **com_status**: Binary variable of species economic status<br>
22. **order**: Species taxonomy - Order
23. **family**: Species taxonomy - Family
24. **class**: Species taxonomy - Class
25. **total_catch_cat**: Catch categorization (see definitions)
26. **total_catch_spp**: Board species categorization
27. **categories**: More narrow species categorization <br>
28. **sci_name**: Latin names for each species
29. **alpha_code**: Unique 3-alpha species identifier used by FAO
30. **com_name**: Local name or "call name" for species 
31. **sample_wt_lbs**: Species sample weight per drag (in lbs) 
32. **total_wt_lbs**: Species total weight per drag (in lbs)

From (Table \@ref(tab:tab01)) we can get a quick view of the first few rows of the data and the old variable names before they are changed. 

```{r tab01}
Table.1.1 <- head(ObserverData) 

Table.1.1 %>% 
  kbl(caption = "The first six rows of data",
    align = "l") %>%
  kable_classic() %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped",
      "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "770px", height = "550px")

### CODE COMMENTS ###
#[1]. A peek at first 6 rows in data using head().
#[2]. kable() is used to create a scrollable html table. This is useful for data with many variables 
#     like this one. 
```

**Renaming of all the variables from the data**

```{r 0.4}
# Renaming of variables 
ObserverData <-  ObserverData %>% 
  dplyr::rename(Company = company, 
    Departure = dep_date,
    Arrival = arr_date, 
    DaysAtSea = das, 
    TripID = trip, 
    DragID = drag, 
    DragID2 = drag_all, 
    DragDate = drag_date,
    Day = day,
    Month = month,
    Year = year,
    FishingZones = zone,
    TimePeriods = drag_period, 
    DragStart = drag_time_s, 
    DragEnd = drag_time_e, 
    TimeFishedHrs = time_fished_min, 
    TimeFishedDec = hrs_dec, 
    FishingDepthFtm = depth, 
    FishingDepth2 = depth_sd, 
    SpeciesID = id_status, 
    EconomicStatus = com_status, 
    OrderTax = order, 
    FamilyTax = family, 
    ClassTax = class, 
    CatchCategory = total_catch_cat, 
    SpeciesCategory = total_catch_spp, 
    SpeciesCategory2 = categories,
    SpeciesCategory3 = categories2,
    LatinNames = sci_name, 
    AplhaCode = alpha_code, 
    CommonName = com_name, 
    SampleWeightLB = sample_wt_lbs, 
    TotalWeightLB = total_wt_lbs)
```

## Creating a few additonal variables

Four new variables were added to the data. These variables will change the convert older variables from **Imperial** to **Metric** units (e.g. pounds to kilograms).  

```{r 0.5}
ObserverData <- ObserverData %>% 
  mutate(SampleWeightKG = round(SampleWeightLB/2.2, 2), 
    TotalWeightKG = round(TotalWeightLB/2.2, 2),
    CpueKGHR = round(TotalWeightKG/TimeFishedDec, 5),
    FishingDepthMtr = round(FishingDepthFtm*1.8288))
```

## Dividing the data up by catch groups

```{r 0.6}
DiscardedCatch <- ObserverData %>%
  filter(CatchCategory == "Discarded catch")

IncidentalCatch <- ObserverData %>%
  filter(CatchCategory == "Incidental catch")

TargetCatch <- ObserverData %>%
  filter(CatchCategory == "Target catch")
```

### Data by bottom trawl tows sampled - Appendix

```{r 0.7}
# Creating Table
SummaryTable <- ObserverData %>% 
  group_by(TripID,
    Company,
    DragID2,
    Departure,
    Month,
    TimePeriods,
    FishingZones,
    FishingDepthMtr,
    Arrival,
    CatchCategory) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(SumWeightsKG = round(sum(TotalWeightKG),2),
    MeanEffortHr = round(mean(TimeFishedDec),2),
    CpueKGHr = round(SumWeightsKG/MeanEffortHr,2),
    CountSpecies = n()) %>%  
  mutate(PropWeight = round(SumWeightsKG/sum(SumWeightsKG),2)) %>%   arrange(DragID2)


# Print Table
SummaryTable %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_classic() %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T,
    bootstrap_options = "condensed") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "750px", height = "600px")
