	abstract = {The Atlantic seabob (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) trawl fishery is very important to Guyana, with 88 licensed industrial vessels harvesting about 15,000 mt annually, representing Guyana’s most valuable seafood export. All vessels are already using both teleost by—catch rKedeuyctiWon odervdicse:s M(BeRgDasl)opainddaet,uErtlloepeifxocrlmud, elerpdtoecveicpehsal(iT, EGDusl)f otof Msaetixsifcyoi,nmteerntaamtioonrpahl omsiasrket standards. However, the key stakeholder, the Guyana Association of Private Trawler Owners and Seafood Processors, is now seeking to access sustainable seafood markets through pursuing Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification. To this end, this study documents elasmobranch by—catch in the current fishery and examines the effectiveness of a modified TED (with a reduced bar spacing and the addition of a brace bar) in reducing elasmobranch by—catch. From July—August 2014, 131 tows were made, 80 of which represented simultaneous hauls with control and modified TEDs. One shark and 8 ray species were recorded. A statistically significant 40\% decline in the elasmobranch catch rate was observed when using modified TEDs compared with control TEDs (mean by—catch rate dropped from 2.3 to 1.4 individuals per twin—trawl/h). Furthermore, modified TEDs significantly reduced the mean size of rays caught by 6.3\%. This also resulted in a virtual elimination of 3 IUCN—designated 'Near Threatened' ray species in the by—catch, although having little effect on the capture of small—sized elasmobranch species, including the 'Critically Endangered' Caribbean Electric Ray (Narcine bancroftii). We conclude that the modified TED was successful in reducing the by—catch of vulnerable elasmobranch species and should advance progress towards attaining by—catch standards required for MSC certification.},

	abstract = {Red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) is the most important demersal resource in the Northwest Mediterranean. In Northeast Spain it is fished by bottom trawling and constitutes a large part of the income for local fishermen’s associations. In Palamós, the most important harbour for this fishery in the area, a management plan regulating this fishery was established in May 2013, aiming to reduce fishing effort and protect juveniles. We investigate whether the management strategy adopted in Palamós is appropriate and how it could be improved according to the stock status and fishery characteristics. For this purpose we analyze the trends of several historical series of data including fishing effort, landings, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and size frequencies in the catches. We found that fishing effort directed to this species has increased massively starting form the second half of the last century, accompanied by a marked decline in CPUE. Overfishing of the stock has been evident since 1984. Given the results obtained in this work, we consider the management strategy recently established in Palamós will be appropriate to achieve the aim of sustainability for the red shrimp fishery.},

	abstract = {The Faroe Islands have had ﬁve diﬀerent ﬁsheries management regimes for their demersal home ﬂeet between 1948 and 2018: open access; regulated open access; a licensing system; a brief period of individual transferable quotas (ITQ); and, since 1996, an eﬀort quota system, where the main control component comprises ﬁshing days without total allowable catch (TAC) control. The Faroese cod and haddock stocks are severely overﬁshed, and the ﬂeet is largely unproﬁtable because of excess capacity and the stocks’ poor state. This paper describes and analyses the main characteristics of the regimes and developments in policy to determine why management has failed. The results are compared with the Faroese pelagic and distant-water ﬂeets, which are managed jointly with other coastal states using TAC and ITQ, to identify inconsistencies in policy and implementation. The conclusion is that the Faroese authorities have 1) persistently believed that ﬁshing can be directed away from overﬁshed stocks but have failed to accomplish this; 2) demonstrated short-sightedness in the management of their demersal ﬁshery; 3) shown an unwillingness to eﬀectively reduce ﬁshing pressure and — by implication –employment in the ﬁsheries sector for the sake of sustainability; and 4) shown that they can manage their ﬂeets sustainably, as demonstrated by the pelagic and distant-water ﬂeets, but have largely been unwilling to regarding the home ﬂeet.},

	abstract = {The home fishery in the Faroe Islands has since 1996 been managed predominantly with fishing days. The system has proven ineffective and has led to overfishing, fleet overcapacity, and low profitability in the home fishery. A process of reform began in 2007 when fishing licenses were terminated, effective from January 1, 2018. A fisheries policy reform was adopted by the Faroese Parliament in December 2017, just weeks before licenses expired. This paper describes the substantial fisheries policy reform and analyses its likely effectiveness and impact on the Faroese fishing industry. New measures include total allowable catch and individual transferable quotas for parts of the home fleet; allocation of fishing rights through auctions and development quotas; harvest fees; and the complete elimination of foreign ownership and capital. The fishing days system will remain in place for the coastal fleet. We identify a number of barriers for success, most notably that measures to ensure sustainability in the home fishery only apply to parts of the fleet, which may render them ineffective and hinder the much needed recovery of the important cod and haddock stocks in Faroese waters. Full implementation of the fisheries reform may be hindered by a lack of political consensus on a number of matters, and ultimately, full implementation depends on the outcome of the next general election in the Faroe Islands (2019), as the current opposition has made it clear it prefers the fishing days system.},

	abstract = {During an effort-regulated period from 1996 to 2002, unregistered annual increases of 0.3\% of hooks fished per day were demonstrated for the Faroe Islands longline fishery. However, annual increases were higher (1.5\%) during a preceding total allowable catch regulated period, thereby invalidating an expectation of the 1996 shift in regulations (output to input control) to have induced increases in the number of hooks set per day. Underlying this result is a substantial increase in total yearly effort (fishing days) and a shift in targeting behaviour from secondary to primary (high value) target species in response to the transition from output to input control. Interview data on technology were combined with logbook data and analysed with generalized linear modelling to demonstrate haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) catch-per-unit-effort increases of 51\% and 26\%, respectively, following the introduction of skewed hooks and swivel line. The technological introductions were not correlated to regulation shifts. So, rather than the management system in force, an ongoing technological development seems to be the principal driver of fishing power trends. The results highlight the need to explicitly address technological development and targeting behaviour when attempting to meet conservation objectives through input control of fisheries.},

            Jákupsstovu, S. H. í, Cruz, L. R., Maguire, J-J., and Reinert, J. 2007. Effort regulation of the demersal fisheries at the Faroe Islands: a 10-year appraisal. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 730–737. Since 1996, the demersal fisheries for cod, haddock, and saithe in Faroese waters have been regulated by a combination of fishing licenses, effort quota (days fishing), and area closures. The number of days initially allocated aimed at exerting an average annual fishing mortality rate of 0.45 on each of the three species. Considering that these stocks are taken in mixed fisheries, it had been hypothesized that effort would be targeted at the most available species, resulting in lower fishing mortality on the less available species, allowing them to recover. We review ten years of experience with the management system with special focus on the underlying assumptions. Although the system appears to have achieved an appropriate balance in catch opportunities among the different fleet components and has minimized interference among gears, the objective of controlling fishing mortality on cod and saithe below the stated objective has not been achieved, partly because the original number of days allocated to fishing was too high. Also, there is no evidence that fleets switch target species according to relative abundance of all three species, which was one of the underlying assumptions of the effort management system. In view of the impact of major changes in productivity on stock development and exploitation, the current system cannot be expected to ensure spawning-stock biomasses above safe biological limits without a large reduction in the number of days allocated.},

	abstract = {The Workshop on Investing in Ecosystem-based shrimp and groundfish fisheries management of the Guianas –Brazil shelf, was held in Barbados, on 7-8 September 2015. The Workshop was the 1st meeting of the joint Working Group on Shrimp and Groundfish of the Western Central Atlantic Fisheries Commission (WECAFC), Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), and the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Seas (IFREMER). The workshop discussed the status of the shrimp and groundfish stocks, investment options for shrimp and groundfish fisheries in the sub-region - which comprises Brazil, Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname - and opportunities to harmonize fisheries management measures that would increase financial and environmental sustainability of the sector. The experts attending the workshop discussed three background documents on bioeconomic analysis of the fisheries, the current management arrangements as well as a proposal of investment plan for the shrimp and groundfish fisheries in the sub-region; all three documents are included in this volume. Based on these discussions, recommendations were made to increase collaboration in stock assessments of the fish and shrimp resources between the countries, to build capacity to carry out the necessary analyses in support of fisheries management decision making, to develop a regional plan of action to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing as well as a sub-regional shrimp and groundfish fishery management plan for the Northern Brazil-Guianas Shelf countries, to finalize a general investment plan and to assist the countries in conducting the necessary feasibility studies for the preparation of full-fledged, location specific fisheries investment proposals. The implementation of these recommendations are in line with the outcomes of the CLME+ project on “Catalysing Implementation of the Strategic Action Programme for the Sustainable Management of shared Living Marine Resources in the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems”. As a result, the CLME+ is an adequate support for the execution of a number of management and investment measures that were identified by the regional experts.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, many species of elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are currently threatened by marine ﬁsheries activity and are on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for teleost ﬁsh and Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) are now widespread in tropical shrimp trawling, information on their ability to mitigate bycatch of elasmobranchs, particularly rays (Batoidea), is scarce and limited to only a few isolated ﬁsheries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of trawls ﬁtted with a square-mesh panel BRD and supershooter TED in reducing ray bycatch. In this study, 65 catch-comparison hauls were conducted in the Atlantic seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) ﬁshery off Suriname. Trawls with a BRD and TED combination reduced ray catch rate by 36\%. A 21\% reduction in mean size indicated the preferential exclusion of large rays. Hence, high escape ratios were observed for Dasyatis geijskesi (77\%), a large-sized species, while exclusion of the small species Urotrygon microphthalmum was not signiﬁcant, although their disc width is small enough to pass through the meshes of the BRD. Furthermore, a size-dependent escape for the two most abundant mid-sized ray species Dasyatis guttata and Gymnura micrura was observed. Exclusion-at-size differed for both species, however, likely related to species-speciﬁc morphology or behavior in response to the TED. This study shows that the combination of BRD and TED causes an important reduction in ray bycatch in seabob shrimp ﬁsheries off Suriname. The great reduction in catch of large-sized rays is positive, but the mortality of juvenile rays is likely to have negative consequences for their populations. We therefore recommend gear-based and non-gear adaptations to further reduce the bycatch of small-sized rays.},

	title = {Impact of {Guyana} seabob trawl fishery on marine habitats and ecosystems: {A} preliminary assessment},
	abstract = {This study aimed to make a preliminary assessment of the impact of Guyana seabob shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri trawl fisheries on marine habitats and ecosystems, related to the fishery’s efforts to comply with the certification standards of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Research on the ecological impact of seabob trawling has recently been concluded in neighboring Suriname. The current study collected information on the coastal ecosystem of Guyana, to estimate whether the findings from Suriname might also apply to the Guyana fishery. A trawl survey was conducted in which 20 locations across the Guyana shelf and along a depth gradient from 6 to 34 m were sampled both in the rainy (May 2017) and dry (November 2017) season. To allow for direct comparison, the study design, sampling gear and procedures were identical to Suriname research. Environmental characteristics, and the communities of both epibenthos (benthic invertebrates) and demersal (bottom dwelling) fish showed a marked inshore-offshore depth gradient. Coastal assemblages of epibenthos and fish occurred at 6, 13 and 20 m depth, in relatively turbid waters over muddy seabed sediments. From 27 m onward, offshore assemblages were discerned, characterized by higher epibenthic species richness, clearer waters and coarser sediments. These results show that the marine environment on the Guyana shelf is very similar to Suriname, and characterized by a major shift around the 30 m isobath between a coastal and offshore ecosystem. Like in Suriname, the impact of trawling on marine habitats (MSC principle P2.4) is likely limited due to the naturally dynamic nature of the seabeds in the coastal ecosystem. While the fishery’s influence on the wider ecosystem (P2.5) might be limited as well, the Guyana seabob fishery is characterized by a larger trawling fleet and trawling grounds extending into shallower areas closer to the coast. These differences do not allow for a direct extrapolation of the findings from Suriname related to P2.5. It is advised to quantify the ecosystem impact through further research. Precautionary management measures that reduce the fishing mortality of target and/or bycatch species could reduce to overall ecosystem impact of the fishery in absence of such research.},

	abstract = {Inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis of the root causes of overfishing can lead to misguided and ineffective fisheries policies and programmes. The “Malthusian overfishing narrative” suggests that overfishing is driven by too many fishers chasing too few fish and that fishing effort grows proportionately to human population growth, requiring policy interventions that reduce fisher access, the number of fishers, or the human population. By neglecting other drivers of overfishing that may be more directly related to fishing pressure and provide more tangible policy levers for achieving fisheries sustainability, Malthusian overfishing relegates blame to regions of the world with high population growth rates, while consumers, corporations and political systems responsible for these other mediating drivers remain unexamined. While social–ecological systems literature has provided alternatives to the Malthusian paradigm, its focus on institutions and organized social units often fails to address fundamental issues of power and politics that have inhibited the design and implementation of effective fisheries policy. Here, we apply a political ecology lens to unpack Malthusian overfishing and, relying upon insights derived from the social sciences, reconstruct the narrative incorporating four exemplar mediating drivers: technology and innovation, resource demand and distribution, marginalization and equity, and governance and management. We argue that a more nuanced understanding of such factors will lead to effective and equitable fisheries policies and programmes, by identifying a suite of policy levers designed to address the root causes of overfishing in diverse contexts.},

Regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive institutions and their rapid/slow moving properties are analyzed. The results show that dynamics of cooperation and conflict between different institutional elements and the balance of forces among actors are crucial to understand fisheries management dynamics. Regulations are, despite their importance, insufficient to promote sound management if they are not backed up by norms and cultural-cognitive institutions. Fisheries management would benefit by broadening the institutional perspective to increase the efficiency of management and to avoid blueprint solutions.

	abstract = {Increasing attention is being paid to overfishing and the biological, economic, and social implications of persistent mismanagement of aquatic natural resources. In this chorus of concern, little attention is focused on sustainable fisheries, and the lessons to be learned from management systems that produce these successes. Although there is no one prescription for sustainability, a range of quota-based management tools have been used to eliminate the race for fish, increasing the incentives for long-term investment and efficiency. Variously referred to as fishing rights, tenure rights, or dedicated access privileges, quota-based fisheries confer a percentage (or quota) of the total allowable catch to named entities over some predetermined period, from short-term auction systems to intergenerational customary sea tenure. Whether a rights-based system stems from a traditional fishing rights system or has been recently introduced into modern commercial fisheries, achieving sustainability in the fishery is dependent on incentivizing the collective – from local communities to national fleets – to actively participate in self-regulation of the resource. Thus criticism of the approach often stems from the observation of the potential for cheating at the individual level (e.g., high grading, excessive discards), and the necessary exclusivity that accompanies any transition in management from open access to club membership. It is also worth noting that the resource in question – the fish – remain a public good, and as such, the public should be compensated – or at least not taxed – for their use. Thus the cost of fishery management, and the windfall profits of fishery conversion, should be shared. Rights-based management is not a silver bullet, and is probably not appropriate for all fisheries; however, the successes of the longline fisheries for Pacific halibut and sablefish in Alaska, the artisanal fisheries for loco in Chile and for spiny lobster in Mexico, and the Australian fisheries for Northern prawns and rock lobster, all clearly indicate that fishing rights should have a central place in the fisheries management toolbox.},

	abstract = {The management of fishing capacity—in both inland and marine fisheries—is a major policy concern in most countries in Southeast Asia. Excess capacity leads to a number of negative impacts, such as resource use conflicts, overfishing, environmental degradation, economic wastage, and security threats. This paper presents the results of a regional study that examined various approaches to managing excess fishing capacity in small-scale fisheries in Southeast Asia. More specifically, the paper presents an analysis of perceptions of stakeholders in Cambodia, Philippines and Thailand regarding preferred solutions to addressing excess capacity. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy guidance for addressing excess fishing capacity based on the stakeholder-preferred solutions.},

	abstract = {The risks and benefits associated with a given fishery-management measure, such as choice of a total allowable catch (TAC), depend on how future measures are to be chosen. It is therefore more appropriate to assess the risks and benefits of procedures or algorithms for determining management actions rather than those of single actions. The properties of a management algorithm can be explored by simulating its behaviour in hypothetical test scenarios. In each scenario, annual data with random error are generated from a simulated fishery and used by the algorithm to determine the TAC or other management measure for the next year. The performance of a management algorithm is measured against a variety of competing criteria that reflect the extent to which it achieves the conservation of fish resources, allows a reasonable level of utilization, and provides an acceptable degree of stability in catch or effort limits. Through an iterative process of testing and development, a management algorithm can be found that is robust towards uncertainties and that can be tuned to provide the desired trade-off between competing performance goals. The approach is illustrated using the Catch Limit Algorithm developed for the management of baleen whale harvests.},

	abstract = {Emerging as an innovation for improving the management of overexploited fisheries around the world, rights-based fisheries management systems are being implemented in the form of either species- or area-based management. While there are numerous reviews on species-based management, there have been none on area-based management. To fill this gap, we undertake a critical review of the literature on area-based management systems known as “Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries” (or TURFs). Following an exhaustive search, seventy-nine peer-reviewed journal papers discussing the evolution, effectiveness, enforcement, and management context of TURFs were identified and selected. Review of these papers reveals that there is a growing interest in investigating the real-world effects of TURFs, both positive and negative. The variability in TURF performance appears to be due to design features, enforcement behavior of fishers, and specific contextual conditions, namely, biological fishery characteristics, socio-economic aspects of fishers, and institutional arrangements. The bulk of the published research has focused on theoretical analysis and empirical evidence based on fishers’ perception and experience. And there has been little research on enforcement issues or how design features and management contexts influence performance. This review emphasizes the need for rigorous empirical analyses of TURF effects, including assessment of the cost-effectiveness of different enforcement schemes and the effects of contextual conditions on TURF performance. Addressing current shortcomings in the literature could improve the design, implementation and performance of TURFs worldwide.},

This paper identifies key factors in market structure in recent decades that contribute to long run profitability of the Icelandic fishing (and fish processing) industry using semi-structured interviews with industry participants, and compares those with similar results from Norway. Further, the development of profitability in the Icelandic and Norwegian demersal fishing industries is used to assess the long run effects of different management systems on quality, product focus and profitability. The results indicate that three key changes in Icelandic regulation during the 1980s were important to the development of long run profitability within the fishing industry: the abolition of export barriers, the introduction of an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system and the establishment of fish auctions. A large and growing literature supports the role of ITQs in ensuring long run profitability. The importance of market structure for profitability has only recently been identified, affecting the ability of value chains to become market oriented and supply homogenous product flow from heterogeneous raw material. Comparison with Norway indicates that while individual transferable quota management does improve profitability in fishing to a certain extent, management systems must facilitate a strong market connection from consumers, through the stages of retail and processing, to fishers for the full realization of profit potential in the fishing industry.},

	abstract = {The Icelandic fishing industry has had to deal with reduced total catch for the past three decades. It has adapted well to the reduction and the Icelandic ITQ system has made this easier. The industry has adapted by reducing employment, closing factories and scrapping boats. Specialization has as well increased and the focus is more toward high-value markets. The profitability of the Icelandic fishing industry has markedly increased. This is especially true for the processing aspect of the industry where profits have soared. One of the main reasons for this increase is the ITQ management system. The rise in profitability of the fishing component, however, is considerably less than that of the processing part. This is the result of higher oil prices and the introduction of the fishing fee, and its subsequent increase, which is now a considerable expense for the fishing component of the Icelandic fishing industry. The debt levels of the industry reached a peak in 2008 after a massive escalation which began in 2004 and was mainly caused by the Icelandic financial bubble, 2004-2008, although the ITQ system also played a role here. Since 2008 the financial health of the industry has improved enormously. Currently, the financial situation of the Icelandic fishing industry is, on the average, sound; this particularly applies to the largest and smallest firms.},

	abstract = {Iceland׳s fishing industry has outperformed fishing industries in neighboring countries in recent years. This paper identifies key factors in market structure in recent decades that contribute to long run profitability of the Icelandic fishing (and fish processing) industry using semi-structured interviews with industry participants, and compares those with similar results from Norway. Further, the development of profitability in the Icelandic and Norwegian demersal fishing industries is used to assess the long run effects of different management systems on quality, product focus and profitability. The results indicate that three key changes in Icelandic regulation during the 1980s were important to the development of long run profitability within the fishing industry: the abolition of export barriers, the introduction of an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system and the establishment of fish auctions. A large and growing literature supports the role of ITQs in ensuring long run profitability. The importance of market structure for profitability has only recently been identified, affecting the ability of value chains to become market oriented and supply homogenous product flow from heterogeneous raw material. Comparison with Norway indicates that while individual transferable quota management does improve profitability in fishing to a certain extent, management systems must facilitate a strong market connection from consumers, through the stages of retail and processing, to fishers for the full realization of profit potential in the fishing industry.},

	abstract = {Icelandic fish stocks underwent privatisation in 1990, when existing fishing quotas were made fully transferable. The country’s system of individual transferable quotas has since been held up as a paragon of virtue for sustainable fisheries. This might be valid for ecological and most economic concerns, but for a truly sustainable fisheries management system the question of social impacts has to be addressed as well. This paper evaluates the performance of Icelandic fisheries management from a spatial and social point of view. The theoretical framing stems from the concepts of resilience and vulnerability. Through cluster and correlation analyses, different development trajectories of Icelandic fishing communities since 1990 are revealed. The results are presented on maps. Even though it is no longer the country’s largest economic sector, the livelihood of many small and remote settlements is strongly connected to the fisheries. Consolidation has taken place in the fisheries and rural-to-urban migration has continued. The majority of coastal communities can be classified as vulnerable, regarding the status of the local fishing industry in 2014. Regarding demographic development, the number of vulnerable communities was significantly higher in 2014 than it was at the early 1990s.},

	abstract = {During the past three decades considerable changes have taken place within the Icelandic pelagic industry which, previously considered rather fragmented, is now a highly concentrated vertically integrated industry due to considerable consolidations of quotas. During this period, changes in the ecosystem around Iceland have also brought valuable pelagic species such as Atlanto-Scandian herring and Atlantic mackerel to the EEZ, while other species such as capelin have declined. Part of the concentration within the pelagic sector can be attributed to changes in the ITQ management system and company adjustments to laws and regulations. Another aspect can be attributed to the entrance of valuable species into the Icelandic EEZ and decreasing quotas of fishmeal oriented species. Finally technology changes have increased production efficiency in processing and fisheries. All this has altered the Icelandic pelagic industry in three ways: Firstly, processing for human consumption has increased with additional species and advances in processing technology. Secondly, raw material for the fishmeal industry has declined parallel with lower capelin quotas. Thirdly, a number of processing utilities and vessels have been scrapped, affecting employment in many fishing villages.},

The paper investigates to what extent the power of different stakeholders in the fisheries management system has changed, and examines whether and in which fields enhanced participation is favoured by relevant stakeholder groups. Strengths and weaknesses of participation within the system are scrutinized and alternatives assessed. The analytical framework stems from the concept of adaptive co-management, whereas the empirical data derives from a survey on Icelandic fisheries management among important stakeholder groups. This survey showed that the critique of individual transferable quotas is not homogeneous. Regional differences are present regarding the evaluation of the current regime, but also of proposed alternative management instruments. Overall, more stakeholder participation, especially in data gathering and decision making, is demanded. This has in fact decreased over time. The authors suggest that the perceived shortcomings of the quota system in general and the lack of stakeholder participation in particular, can be addressed by adopting certain elements of adaptive co-management.},

The trawl with the grid and diamond mesh codend caught no cod of marketable size and fewer large whiting, plaice and haddock than the standard trawl. However, that trawl caught twice the number of small cod and more haddock (and more Nephrops), as did the standard trawl. The trawl with the grid and square-mesh codend caught less cod, haddock and whiting in all length classes, but Nephrops catches were around half that of the standard trawl. Using the grid meant a ∼75\% reduction in revenue from bycaught fish and squid landings, and when combined with the square-mesh codend, a further reduction of 50\% in revenue from Nephrops landings.

Preliminary flume tank studies were performed jointly with the Sea Fish Industry Authority (SFIA) in Hull. Observations indicated that the meshes in a panel of netting with square-shaped meshes inserted into the top of a trawl net remained open when the net was under tension, whereas the traditional diamond-shaped meshes tended to close. Trials at sea using the SOAFD (Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department) remote-controlled television vehicle (RCTV) confirmed that under tension the diamond-shaped meshes towards the end of the net closed during trawling whereas the square-shaped meshes of a panel inserted in this region remained open. Good escapement of small fish through the square mesh panel was filmed during trawling. Nephrops tended to scuttle along the bottom of the net and did not escape. Commercial fishing trials using a vessel rigged to pull two trawl nets simultaneously, one with a square mesh panel and one without, demonstrated significantly better whiting escapement from the net with the square panel than from the conventional all-diamond net. Results obtained from this investigation suggest that a panel of square-shaped mesh fitted to a Nephrops trawl could be an important whiting conservation tool.},

It may include small individuals of the target species, or other species with little or no commercial value. The problem is widespread, with a global estimate of approximately 20 million metric tonnes, representing about a quarter of the total world catch. Shrimp fisheries tend to generate the largest quantities of by-catch, while fisheries for small pelagics the least. By-catch rates in mixed demersal and large pelagic fisheries are intermediate.},

This paper investigates the macroeconomic effects of the waste recycling process, with particular reference to a country, such as Italy, which uses many foreign non-renewable resources. We use the Keynesian multiplier theory as a theoretical framework to evaluate the potential results of an increase in waste recycling on the gross national product, the balance of payments and employment. In such a way the policy maker can better evaluate whether to promote the process considered here rather than discharging the waste in the environment.},

	abstract = {Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which can readily be moulded into a variety of products that find use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of plastics has increased markedly over the last 60 years. However, current levels of their usage and disposal generate several environmental problems. Around 4 per cent of world oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock for plastics and a further 3–4\% is expended to provide energy for their manufacture. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year of manufacture. These two observations alone indicate that our current use of plastics is not sustainable. In addition, because of the durability of the polymers involved, substantial quantities of discarded end-of-life plastics are accumulating as debris in landfills and in natural habitats worldwide.Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these impacts and represents one of the most dynamic areas in the plastics industry today. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of waste requiring disposal. Here, we briefly set recycling into context against other waste-reduction strategies, namely reduction in material use through downgauging or product reuse, the use of alternative biodegradable materials and energy recovery as fuel.While plastics have been recycled since the 1970s, the quantities that are recycled vary geographically, according to plastic type and application. Recycling of packaging materials has seen rapid expansion over the last decades in a number of countries. Advances in technologies and systems for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are creating new opportunities for recycling, and with the combined actions of the public, industry and governments it may be possible to divert the majority of plastic waste from landfills to recycling over the next decades.},

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, recycling of waste has become a core element of sustainable development. However, in this article, analysis of the flow modelling shows that recycling in itself is inefficient to perform the necessary "decoupling" of economic development and the depletion of non-renewable raw materials. The depletion of the natural resource of raw material is inevitable when its global consumption by the economy grows by more than 1\% per annum. Recycling can delay for some years or decades at best. Decoupling the economy and its material needs must be understood as a double decoupling, the two components of which being inoperative if they are implemented separately. Only the combination of the two makes a significant impact on the problem of resources: (i) A fundamental decoupling, namely to restrain the growth of total consumption of raw material (virgin or recycled) (ii) A relative decoupling to reduce, through recycling and reuse, the share of primary resources (virgin) in the total production of raw material. In this perspective, the actual role of recycling to protect the resources is not significant for non-renewable materials which consumption tends to grow more than 1\% per year. Conversely, once the fundamental decoupling is performed by other means, so that the growth of total consumption of raw materials is reduced below 1\% per year, recycling becomes indispensable if the rate of effectiveness is very high globally. Only recycling rates above 80\% allow a significant slowdown of the depletion of natural resources. In conclusion, sustainable development policies can not rely primarily on recycling, even though it is an important component. These policies should primarily aim at reducing the consumption of each non renewable raw matérial so that the annual growth rate remains under 1\%. And in any case, to be efficient as the indispensable second part of these policies, recycling should be developed to much higher rates than the ones observed for most recycled materials in the world today.},

	abstract = {Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic ineﬃciency, often referred to as the ﬁsheries problem. The ﬁsheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the ﬁshing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the ﬁsheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the ﬂow of beneﬁts from the ﬁsheries. In reality, diﬀerent interest groups often push for several, often conﬂicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage ﬁsheries is referred to as the ﬁsheries management regime. The ﬁsheries management regime consists of a (i) ﬁsheries management system, (ii) ﬁsheries enforcement system and (iii) ﬁsheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The eﬃcacy of the overall ﬁsheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of ﬁsheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of ﬁsheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the eﬃcacy of the ﬁsheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation.},

Diverse sets of trajectories are formulated varying the challenges to mitigation and adaptation of climate change. The potential CO2 emissions from fossil fuels make it a crucial element subject to deep uncertainties. The analysis is based on a wellestablished dataset of cost-quantity combinations that assumes favorable techno-economic developments, but ignores additional constraints on the extraction sector. This study signiﬁcantly extends the analysis by specifying alternative assumptions for the fossil fuel sector consistent with the SSP scenario families and applying these ﬁlters (mark-ups and scaling factors) to the original dataset, thus resulting in alternative cumulative fossil fuel availability curves. In a Middle-of-the-Road scenario, low cost fossil fuels embody carbon consistent with a RCP6.0 emission proﬁle, if all the CO2 were emitted freely during the 21st century. In scenarios with high challenges to mitigation, the assumed embodied carbon in low-cost fossil fuels can trigger a RCP8.5 scenario; low mitigation challenges scenarios are still consistent with a RCP4.5 scenario.},

Yet these estimates are often highly uncertain, frequently incommensurable, and regularly contested. This paper explores how the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the availability of fossil fuels, biomass and critical metals are conceptualised and communicated. The contention is that a better understanding of the uncertainties surrounding resource estimates for both conventional and renewable energy resources can contribute to more effective policy decision making in the long term. Two complementary approaches for framing uncertainty are considered in detail: a descriptive typology of uncertainties and a framework that conceptualises uncertainty as alternative states of incomplete knowledge. Both have the potential to be useful analytical and communication tools. For the three resource types considered here we ﬁnd that data limitations, inconsistent deﬁnitions and the use of incommensurable methodologies present a pervasive problem that impedes comparison. Many aspects of resource uncertainty are also not commonly captured in the conventional resource classiﬁcation schemes.

In addition to describing the life cycle characteristics of natural gas production and introducing the inter-temporal allocation theory, this paper builds the optimal exploitation model of natural gas resources within a gas ﬁeld in the Ordos Basin as an example to analyze its exploitation scale and how inﬂuence factors, such as recovery rate, discount rate and the gas well exhausting cycle, affect the optimal exploration path of this gas ﬁeld. We determine that an increase in the discount rate stimulates investors to invest more aggressively in natural gas exploitation in the early period due to the lower discounted value, thereby increasing the pace of the exploitation of natural gas and the exhaustion of gas ﬁelds. A higher recoverable factor implies more recoverable reserves and greater potential of increasing the output of gas ﬁelds. The exhaustion rate of gas wells affects the capability of converting capacity to output. When exhaustion occurs quickly in gas wells, the output will likely increase in the output rising period, and the output will likely decrease at a faster rate in the output reduction period. Price reform affects the economic recoverable reserves of gas ﬁelds.},

"Potential reserves" are unlimited, but as depletion ensues, given amounts of exploratory activity result in ever smaller discoveries. Given these constraints, resource producers must simultaneously determine their optimal rates of exploratory activity and production. We solve this problem for competitive and monopolistic markets and show that if the initial reserve endowment is small, the price profile will be U-shaped; at first production will increase as reserves are developed, and later production will decline as both exploratory activity and the discovery rate fall.},

	abstract = {The fundamental requirements for the entrapment of oil and gas are the presence of a mature source rock, migration of those hydrocarbons from there into a trap, which contains an effective reservoir rock and an appropriate seal. There may be a difference of many millions of years in age of the source, reservoir and seal horizons and the timing of hydrocarbon migration and juxtaposition of these rocks to form a trap is critical. 

Once formed, many traps may be destroyed or leak, due to later tectonics.  When prospects are worked up and assessed, the overall “Chance of Success” is calculated on the basis of the probability of the presence and effectiveness of the source, reservoir and trap. This describes the overall ‘risk’ of finding hydrocarbons within the range estimated and this may vary from 10\% in frontier basins to 30—50\% in proven basins.

There is also ‘uncertainty’, which describes the range of outcomes, even when, say the reservoir rock is found to be present. 

    How thick is it?
    How porous and permeable?
    Is the original depositional facies as predicted?
    How connected is it across the prospect?

There is also uncertainty even when hydrocarbons are found, as only a certain amount of appraisal wells can be afforded to establish the range of reserves, before making a multi-billion-dollar decision to develop the field.

Above surface uncertainty also exists.  The oil and gas business is a capital intensive, long term business. An oil or gas field may have a life of 5 to 50 years, depending on size and economics.  There will be uncertainty of future oil price, government tax rates and in some cases, the future political stability of the host country.

Environmental sensitivity, community relationships and ‘licence to operate’ are all key aspects which must also be assessed.  And of course, the impact of fossil fuels on global warming and climate change, is now also a firm part of the context for any decisions, as the world needs to move to a lower carbon environment.

	abstract = {Our study assessed 16 different Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for use in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), during three cruises in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The study was a response to pressure from conservation and community groups to make harvesting of the sea more selective and less damaging to the non-target communities. The approach was to incrementally improve the performance of BRDs after each stage: underwater observations in a flume tank and engineering trials at sea; rigorous and controlled scientific trials on the RV Southern Surveyor; testing under normal commercial fishing conditions. Bycatch Reduction Devices were improved throughout these procedures; only the best-performing devices were tested in the next stage. All four inclined grids (Super Shooter, Nordmøre grid, AusTED and NAFTED) were extremely effective at excluding large sharks, stingrays and sea turtles. They were also effective at excluding some of the unwanted small-fish catch, especially when used in combination with other BRDs, such as a fisheye or square-mesh window. Fish exclusion ranged between 0 and 39\%. Exclusion of sea snakes was substantially increased by using BRDs, such as the AusTED or square-mesh windows. The ability of BRDs to maintain the catch of the target species was part of the assessment. The Super Shooter had the best prawn retention rate, losing only between 2 and 12\% of prawns in scientific trials and gaining 3.4\% during the commercial trials. The Super Shooter also performs well in areas where the other inclined grids tend to clog with sponges or other large objects. The NAFTED, which was used only during the commercial trials, lost only 3.3\% of the prawn catch of a standard trawl. There is evidence that the fisheye may increase prawn catches. Other devices lost substantial numbers of prawns, but modifications could greatly improve their performance. Some of these devices could be used successfully in their present form. The performance of most BRDs were also strongly affected by the weather and fishing procedures, such as delay in haulback of the trawl. This study has shown that there are BRDs that can be of major benefit to prawn trawl fishers in the NPF, by excluding much of the unwanted bycatch while maintaining catches of commercially valuable prawns. The main benefits to the NPF fishery of using BRDs are:•fewer or no sea turtles caught or killed;•fewer small fish to be sorted from catches;•fewer large animals (stingrays, sharks and sea turtles) that can damage valuable prawns, resulting in a higher catch value; and•decreased fishing impacts on bycatch species, which helps to maintain ecological biodiversity and resilience of these demersal communities. Failure of the NPF and other Australian prawn trawl fisheries to voluntarily adopt BRDs may result in an involuntary adoption brought on by pressures from community, conservation and trade bodies.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, many species of elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are currently threatened by marine fisheries activity and are on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for teleost fish and Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) are now widespread in tropical shrimp trawling, information on their ability to mitigate bycatch of elasmobranchs, particularly rays (Batoidea), is scarce and limited to only a few isolated fisheries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of trawls fitted with a square-mesh panel BRD and super-shooter TED in reducing ray bycatch. In this study, 65 catch-comparison hauls were conducted in the Atlantic seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) fishery off Suriname. Trawls with a BRD and TED combination reduced ray catch rate by 36\%. A 21\% reduction in mean size indicated the preferential exclusion of large rays. Hence, high escape ratios were observed for Dasyatis geijskesi (77\%), a large-sized species, while exclusion of the small species Urotrygon microphthalmum was not significant, although their disc width is small enough to pass through the meshes of the BRD. Furthermore, a size-dependent escape for the two most abundant mid-sized ray species Dasyatis guttata and Gymnura micrura was observed. Exclusion-at-size differed for both species, however, likely related to species-specific morphology or behavior in response to the TED. This study shows that the combination of BRD and TED causes an important reduction in ray bycatch in seabob shrimp fisheries off Suriname. The great reduction in catch of large-sized rays is positive, but the mortality of juvenile rays is likely to have negative consequences for their populations. We therefore recommend gear-based and non-gear adaptations to further reduce the bycatch of small-sized rays.},

	abstract = {The Chilean hake trawl fishery is one of the most emblematic fisheries in Chile. Considering the type of trawl gear used in the industrial fleet and the variety of species which cohabitates this target specie, discarding has become a recurrent practice, where the jumbo squid and the Chilean hake are often part of the discarded fauna. This problem has been monitored since the amendment of General Fisheries and Aquaculture Law in Chile in 2012, where a definition for discard was incorporated, regulations were modified and sanctions were established for those who engage in this practice. To date, the estimates of discards in this fishery have experienced a reduction from five to one thousand tons, decreasing the amount of discarded catch of Chilean hake and jumbo squid. This reduction is coincident with the introduction of the rigid separation grid in the bottom trawls of the vessels that adopted its use. This article describes the use of the rigid separation grid in trawl hauls aimed at Chilean hake, in which there were fewer hauls with the presence of jumbo squid and also reduced the capture and the catch per unit effort of this species. Besides, an experimental work, which involved the use of a cover codend to retain the fraction of escaping fish due to the use of the grid, allow to verify the jumbo squid escape. The results allow concluding that the use of this device has shown to be effective allowing the escape rate of non-target species catch, as well to posterior discards of these species.},

Primarily, concerns arisefrom the perception that prawn trawls catch anddiscard large numbers of juveniles of species that,when larger, are targeted in other commercial andrecreational fisheries. While several managementoptions are available, the majority of fisheries inthe world have attempted to address this issue throughphysical modifications to trawls, designed to improveselectivity. The types of modifications used reflectfishery-specific characteristics; however, mostcan be broadly classified into twocategories, including: (1) those that separate speciesby differences in behaviour; and (2) those thatmechanically exclude unwanted organisms according totheir size. In the present paper, I provide achronological review of publications in the primaryliterature that describe experiments examiningmodifications within these categories. This reviewshows that inherent variabilities among differentfisheries greatly influence the types of designs thatneed to be applied and although some designs have thepotential for application across different fisheries,significant modification and re-evaluation are oftenrequired. By collating information from previousstudies, I also propose a framework encompassingthe various stages involved in developing and applyingsuccessful modifications in prawn-trawl fisheries. The key stages identified include: (1) quantificationof bycatches and accumulation of fishery-relatedinformation; (2) examination and re-evaluation ofmodifications; (3) assessment of damage inflicted onescaping individuals; and (4) promotion of recommendeddesigns.},

The present review aims to describe the current state-of-the-art in discards research, with particular emphasis on the needs and challenges associated with the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in European waters. We briefly review the international and European policy contexts of discarding, how discard data are collected and incorporated into stock assessments, selectivity in fishing and the main consequences of discarding for ecosystem dynamics. We then review implementation issues related to reducing discards under the EAFM and the associated scientific challenges, and conclude with some comments on lessons learned and future directions.},

In this paper, I review the history of finfish bycatch research in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery and explore the use of quotas to reduce finfish bycatch by examining four fisheries that currently use bycatch quotas: (1) the arrow squid trawl fishery of New Zealand, which uses fleet bycatch quotas for sea lion bycatch, (2) the Alaskan groundfish trawl fisheries, which use fleet quotas under a “vessel incentive program” for prohibited species, (3) the groundfish trawl fishery of British Columbia, Canada which uses individual vessel bycatch quotas for prohibited species, and (4) the multi-species trawl fisheries of New Zealand, which use catch balancing, or individual transferable quotas, for most commercially landed species. Based on the bycatch quota experiences in these fisheries, elements of successful bycatch quota programs include: (1) individual accountability, in the form of individual or cooperative bycatch quotas, rather than fleet quotas, (2) 100\% observer coverage, (3) relatively small, manageable fleets, (4) limited landing ports that can be easily monitored, particularly if observer coverage is incomplete, (5) reliable enforcement, (6) penalties that are true disincentives, and (7) some flexibility in the system for fishermen to have alternatives to manage their bycatch. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery, with an estimated 20,000 licensed boats, is currently too large for individual bycatch quotas to be practical, although individual or cooperative bycatch quotas would be excellent strategies for reducing the bycatch of a smaller fleet. Mobile closed areas might be beneficial for reducing the bycatch of particular species, but these short-term closures would require real-time monitoring of bycatch rates and vessel monitoring systems on all vessels. However, under any management regime, incentives and/or rigorously enforced disincentives are the key to successful bycatch reduction.},

	abstract = {Background. Shrimp fisheries using fyke nets have been associated with a massive acquisition of teleost fishes as bycatch, potentially resulting in the decimation of their stocks. Based on this assumption, the presently reported study intended to test an alternative modification of a commonly used fyke net, in order to minimize the impact of its low selectivity. Materials and methods. To evaluate the alternative design proposed in this work, a total of 44 sampling efforts, including 22 with a control gear (CG) and 22 with a modified gear (MG), were conducted at a subtropical coastal lagoon system located in southern Brazil. In all trials, the fyke nets were installed at the fishing area approximately at 18:00 h and removed approximately at 06:00 h. The duration of each trial was nearly 12 h, which was similar to the catching time preferred by local fishermen.
Results. Bycatch (BC) was preponderant in both modalities but the results showed that MG presented a reduction by 66 percentage points in BC catches, being more selective than CG. Additionally, the non-parametric test showed no significant differences of shrimp catches between the fishing gears used (MG and CG). So, the tested bycatch reduction devices (BRD) reduced the bony fishes acquisition preserving the volume of the target catch.
Conclusion. The vertical opening reduction due the adoption of guiding panel + fan upper panel contributed to bycatch reduction, being a consistent BRD to reduce the potential impacts of this fishing gear over the bony fishes stocks.},

	abstract = {This study was predicated by a recent management proposal to mandate square-mesh codends in an Australian estuarine squid trawl fishery, based on their improvements to the selectivity of penaeid trawls deployed across comparable temporal and spatial scales. The assumption of no impacts of a codend cover on the performance of a squid trawl was validated before it was used to quantify the size and species selection of a conventional codend made from 41-mm diamond-shaped mesh and two new designs made from 29- and 32-mm mesh hung on the bar (i.e. square shaped). Compared to the 41-diamond codend, both square-mesh designs incrementally and significantly reduced the catches of a small legally retained teleost (whitebait Hyperlophus vittatus), but had no significant effect on discarded catches (termed ‘bycatch’). The 32-square codend also significantly increased the sizes at 50\% probability of retention for the targeted squid (Luminous Bay squid Loliolus noctiluca and broad squid Photololigo etheridgei), across narrow selection ranges and, because all sizes are retained, consequently reduced their total landed catches. The results support the utility of square-mesh for consistently improving and maintaining lateral openings in codends, but the management of this fishery means that such configurations would result in economic loss, and for the 29- and 32-square codends, no concomitant reduction in bycatch. This study reiterates the need for bycatch issues to be clearly identified and defined on a fishery-specific basis, and prior to the implementation of mitigation measures.},

However, the grid does not reduce the catch of small shrimp and juvenile fish that are able to pass through the spaces between grid bars. A comprehensive project was initiated to reduce finfish discards and small shrimp in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. The project designed, tested, and optimized a size-sorting grid (He and Balzano, 2012a, He and Balzano, 2012b) and a radically modified Nordmøre-style grid (the Rope Grid, He and Balzano, 2011). These previous papers reported the results of the separate designs (either size-sorting grid or the Rope Grid). This paper reports performance of a combination grid in a shrimp trawl consisting of a 9mm spacing size-sorting grid and a Rope Grid. The combination grid (9Rope) reduced both small shrimp and finfish bycatch when compared to a regular Nordmøre Grid (RNG). The new combination grid reduced finfish bycatch by 33\%, with a small reduction of targeted shrimp catch (12\%). The finfish reduction was length-related for three of the above four species with greater reductions for larger individuals. The combination grid is practical to handle and has potential for commercial use in the northern shrimp fishery in Gulf of Maine and other regions where similar target and bycatch species are mixed.},

While much of the bycatch problem is technological in nature due to imperfect selectivity of the fishing gear, fisher behaviour also plays a major role. How, when and where fishers choose to fish can influence catch composition and thereby the quantity of bycatch. Behavioural changes can be encouraged through the development of an appropriate set of incentives — both economic and social — to avoid bycatch and reduce discarding. In this paper, a number of alternative incentive-based bycatch management systems are reviewed. The potential applicability of these systems to quota species, non-commercial species and threatened or conservationdependent species (such as turtles, seals, dolphins) is reviewed, and examples of their application are presented. The review concludes that incentive-based approaches can reduce the level of bycatch and discarding in most fisheries.},

	shorttitle = {An ecosystem approach to fisheries},
	abstract = {Marine fisheries are often known to cause collateral damage to the ecosystem through bycatch and habitat destruction. As traditional fisheries management only considers the target species population, an ecosystem approach to fisheries is needed, and gains interest. Ecosystem-based fisheries management strives for an ecologically sound resource conservation responding to the reality of ecosystem processes, but implementation remains difficult. Studying the coastal zone of Surinam (South-America) the current PhD research aims to build ecological knowledge supporting ecosystem-based management for the exploitation of seabob shrimp. The Atlantic seabob Xiphopenaeus kroyeri (Crustacea: Penaeoidea) (Heller, 1862) is a shrimp species with a broad distribution in the western Atlantic ocean. In line with a widely observed growth and mechanisation of tropical shrimp fleets in recent decades, industrial exploitation of seabob of the Surinam coast began developing in 1996 with the introduction of shrimp trawlers. The mobile fishing gear used by these vessels is low-selective and produces lots of non-target bycatch, mostly discarded back to the sea. Under international pressure, the use of turtle excluder devices became mandatory, drastically reducing marine turtle bycatch. Further improvements in this fishery were made in recent years by introducing a harvest control rule, a restricted fishing area, a vessel monitoring system and applying the FAO code of conduct. Despite this progress, knowledge on the marine coastal ecosystem in Surinam is lacking and the ecological impact of shrimp trawling is largely unknown. In this study, occurrence and migration of the seabob shrimp will be studied in relation to environmental factors, mainly freshwater river outflow which is known to profoundly alter the coastal waters. Next, a food web study will be done to assess the trophic role of seabob in the ecosystem and hence the possible consequences of its large-scale removal by fisheries. A third goal is to quantify the impact of bottom trawling on the benthic ecosystem by comparing trawled and untrawled seabed areas. Finally, research results will be integrated into practical, though ecologically sound management advices for the fishery sector. As the research is from the start supported by both the fishing industry and the government authorities in Surinam, adaptation of an ecosystem approach is likely in the future. This should allow for a sustainable exploitation of the seabob, assuring both the continuation of an important socio-economic activity and the supply of a considerable domestic protein source in Surinam.},

The objectiveof this study was to evaluate the potential of trawls fitted with a square-mesh panel BRD and super-shooter TED in reducing ray bycatch. In this study, 65 catch-comparison hauls were conducted in theAtlantic seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) fishery off Suriname. Trawls with a BRD and TED combi-nation reduced ray catch rate by 36\%. A 21\% reduction in mean size indicated the preferential exclusionof large rays. Hence, high escape ratios were observed for Dasyatis geijskesi (77\%), a large-sized species,while exclusion of the small species Urotrygon microphthalmum was not significant, although their discwidth is small enough to pass through the meshes of the BRD. Furthermore, a size-dependent escapefor the two most abundant mid-sized ray species Dasyatis guttata and Gymnura micrura was observed.Exclusion-at-size differed for both species, however, likely related to species-specific morphology orbehavior in response to the TED. This study shows that the combination of BRD and TED causes an impor-tant reduction in ray bycatch in seabob shrimp fisheries off Suriname. The great reduction in catch oflarge-sized rays is positive, but the mortality of juvenile rays is likely to have negative consequences fortheir populations. We therefore recommend gear-based and non-gear adaptations to further reduce thebycatch of small-sized rays.},

This coastal penaeid shrimp species has a rather omnivorous diet, feeding opportunistically on both animal prey and primary food sources. The species is a predator of hyperbenthic crustaceans, including copepods, am-phipods and the luciferid shrimp Lucifer faxoni, which are mainly preyed upon during daytime, when these prey typically reside near the seabed. Benthic microalgae (BM) from intertidal mudflats and offshore sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were important primary food sources. Due to their depleted 13 C values, coastal sedimentary and suspended organic matter, and carbon from riverine and mangrove-derived detritus were not incorporated by X. kroyeri. An ontogenetic diet shift was observed from postlavae to juveniles and adults. Adult X. kroyeri were located higher in the food chain, mainly preying on larger benthic organisms. Intertidal BM were an important food source for all life stages of X. kroyeri, contributing up to 64\% to the overall diet based on a Bayesian mixing model. Because X. kroyeri is the main epibenthic organism found at high densities in nearshore waters up to 30 m depth, the species plays a crucial role in transferring energy from low trophic level prey and primary food sources up to higher levels in the food chain. Our results indicate that primary production on intertidal mudflats, through BM, forms an important energy source for the subtidal turbid-water food web in muddy tropical coasts. Conservation of intertidal areas and their associated mangrove systems will therefore likely benefit coastal shrimp production and fisheries in tropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Trawling was conducted in three areas of coastal Louisiana during both 1993 shrimp seasons to evaluate the effectiveness of bycatch reduction devices (BRD's). Two industry-designed devices (Authement-Ledet 2 and CJ Kiffe) and two National Marine Fisheries Service designs (Extended Funnel and Skirted Extended Funnel) were evaluated during the spring. Based on the results from the spring season and diver evaluations, these device nets were modified before the fall season in an attempt to improve effectiveness. Additional tows compared a polyethylene net with the nylon control net. The Authement-Ledet 2, Extended Funnel, and Skirted Extended Funnel nets caught fewer fish (−40, −46, and −25\%) and shrimp (−22, −16, and −21\%) than the control nets. Biomass catch differences were −37, −30, and −35\% for fish and −19, −18, and −21\% for shrimp. Compared with the corresponding control nets, the modified nets caught fewer fish (−22, −44, and −38\%) and shrimp (−16, −5, and −19\%). Biomass catch differences were −27, −50, and −40\% for fish and −9, −5, and −18\% for shrimp. The CJ Kiffe net caught 55\% fewer fish numerically, 62\% less fish biomass, and fewer shrimp (−39\% numbers, −35\% biomass). The CJ Kiffe 2 net caught 4\% more fish (−50\% biomass) than the control net and 18\% fewer shrimp (−22\% biomass). The CJ Kiffe 2 device and codend were constructed with polyethylene webbing and collected 303\% more bay anchovy than the control net. The polyethylene net caught 239\% more bay anchovy and 480\% more striped anchovy than the nylon control net, indicating that polyethylene webbing may retain these species. The modified Extended Funnel design had the best combination of high fish reduction and low shrimp loss of the devices tested. However, the effectiveness of some of the modifications suggests that devices could be further fine-tuned to improve performance.},

	abstract = {This study surveys the international regime governing the use of ocean space by examining various agreements that have come to comprise it. While the regime for the oceans is commonly viewed within the context of a general, universal convention for the law of the sea, the contemporary scope of global oceans law extends far beyond that single instrument. Indeed, the law of the sea is broad, far-reaching and reflective of the increasingly complex, interdependent nature of contemporary international relations. In this regard, by end of the 20th century there has emerged a pronounced trend toward worldwide participation in and adherence to the multifaceted legal regime established to manage the oceans. This panorama of legal instruments focuses both on international instruments and regional accords. The study's premise is this: Since 1958 several multilateral agreements have been negotiated and implemented specifically to regulate various uses of ocean space. Viewed as an integrated whole, these agreements comprise at the beginning of the 21st century an intertwined, sophisticated international legal regime for managing ocean activities. The range of agreements discussed here, however, is neither exhaustive nor meant to suggest that sufficient law is available for regulating all activities affecting the oceans now or in the future. Rather, the survey furnishes a starting point for appreciating just how far the international community has come in establishing a legal regime for managing people and their technological activities that impact on ocean space.},

	abstract = {The World Ocean, the interconnected system of oceans and major seas on Earth, is the basis for climate stability, the hydrological cycle, and many aspects of biological diversity. It provides a wide range of benefits, from serving as a principal sink for carbon dioxide, one of the key greenhouse gases driving anthropogenic climate change, to being a source of subsistence, trade, revenue, jobs, cultural meaning, and recreation. However, the World Ocean is vulnerable to human-induced impacts. Indeed, a substantial amount of the World Ocean has experienced major disturbances, especially in fisheries. The key regulation and politics of marine fisheries and pollution can be divided into three distinct phases, corresponding to three eras in the history and politics of the World Ocean: precolonial era, colonial era, and industrial era. These eras are associated with distinct modes of production and use of the ocean: small coastal precolonial artisanal production, colonial expansion under mare liberum or “freedom of the seas,” and the era of contemporary globalization starting with the Law of the Sea. International fisheries regulatory bodies have shown extreme concern regarding overfishing, but not much for larger ecosystem concerns such as climate change. In addition, international fishing regulation has consistently and regularly suffered from the so-called “regulatory overfishing.” In the case of ocean pollution, three important regulatory regimes that emerged at about the same time are the 1972 Oslo Convention, the 1972 London Dumping Convention, and the 1974 Paris Convention.},

However, the role of fisheries in national and regional economies is neither well documented nor understood. National accounts do not fully reflect the significant part played by the fisheries as they do not take into consideration the various ways economic activity in the fisheries sector affects other branches of the economy. The fisheries sector, which includes fishing and fish processing, has been established as a base industry within the Icelandic economy. Using data collected during 2010 and 2011 and cluster analysis techniques, this paper seeks to establish the economic importance of the fishing industry in Iceland. As a base industry, this paper finds that a wide range of companies have gradually developed to service the sector and through these interlinkages, the fisheries sector and its related operations can be viewed as an industry cluster.},

	abstract = {Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic inefficiency, often referred to as the fisheries problem. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.},

This study attempts to assess the impact of the new CFP on marine food webs. Total carbon and nitrogen loss induced by a discard ban were estimated for the ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay based on French At-Sea Observer data and carbon and nitrogen content of discarded fish. Changes in predator diets were estimated by comparing two Bayesian mixing models, one mimicking the current situation and the second the application of the new CFP (removing the discarded species that would be landed from the model). Results illustrate a substantial shift in predation effort toward remaining available prey. The impact of changes in diet on individual and population health and on ecosystem functioning are important issues that remain to be assessed. A sister study could be carry out in another ecoregion, at a finer spatial scale in order to compare impacts and ecosystem responses. European monitoring programs such as DC-MAP and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) would help us to gain an understanding of how the food web would reorganize itself.},

With this increase in public awareness comes the need to adapt fisheries management policies to manage issues like fisheries discards that were not previously taken into account. In this context, this study analyses the evolution of the European Union's discard policy since its inception in 2006 until the present day and the events that shaped its current format. It analyses the policy's advantages and disadvantages, and its political, environmental and scientific consequences. It argues that an increase in public awareness, due to public campaigns against fisheries discards, has focused managers' attention onto a symptom of fisheries mismanagement, rather than on its underlying causes of over-exploitation and lack of fisheries control. This has distorted the discussion of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and potentially undermined its provisions relating to discards.},

This chapter provides an account of European fishing industry engagement with the discard issue prior to the LO and industry attitudes towards the LO. A discussion about discard management in Europe follows. The fishing industry had a consistent approach to discard management in the run-up to the LO enactment: they favoured fishery-specific discard reduction plans and were unanimously opposed to an outright ‘discard ban’. Canvassing fishers’ opinions from the North Sea (Denmark, France), Eastern and Western Mediterranean (Greece, Spain and France), the Celtic Sea (France, the UK and Ireland), Western English Channel (France) and the Azores between 2015 and 2018 reveals a consistent negative attitude towards the LO. We found that choke species are the main concern outside the Mediterranean Sea while in the Mediterranean region, the cost of disposal and the creation of a black market for juvenile fish are seen as the main negatives. Fishers recognise the necessity of reducing discards although zero discard fisheries are not seen as attainable. They favour a combination of selectivity improvements and spatial management as the best discard reduction measures. New measures to deal with intractable choke species problems are being sought by industry and Member State groups but the European Commission want existing measures to be utilised first. We discuss some potential consequences of negative stakeholders’ attitudes towards this key element of EU fisheries management policy. These include control and compliance challenges, associated business reputation problems for the industry, a longer LO implementation timescale, and deterioration in the quality of scientific data about discards.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the optimal management of fisheries in the ecological context. All fish stocks are embedded in an ecosystem. Therefore, to obtain maximum economic benefits, fisheries management must take due account of the corresponding web of ecological interrelationships. Unfortunately, however, due to the inherent complexity of ecosystems and the scarcity of the relevant empirical information, sensible ecological fisheries management is very difficult to achieve in most cases. This paper suggests a particular application of the individual transferable share quota (ITSQ) system that offers a potentially fruitful approach to the problem of ecological fisheries management. Under the particular ITSQ framework defined in the paper, the task of the fisheries manager is reduced to that of determining the current optimal vector of total allowable catch (TAC); i.e., the one that maximizes the present value of current and expected future fisheries rents from the ecosystem. Given the customary assumptions about market efficiency, this can be shown to be equivalent to setting TACs so that share quota prices are maximized. Since share quota prices are directly observable in the quota market, this is a comparatively easy task for the fisheries manager. This procedure, referred to as minimum information management (MIM) in the paper, obviously greatly simplifies the ecological fisheries management problem. An interesting implication of the analysis is that in the ecological context, economic optimality may easily require some TACs and some share quota prices to be negative.},

The study provides insights into seafood companies’ perspectives on the benefits of implementing traceability. Knowledge on the net benefits of implementing traceability and the distribution of costs and benefits among actors can support decision making. Comprehensive literature review on the necessary components to ensure traceability and a framework developed to assess traceability system effectiveness enable researchers and practitioners in the food/seafood sector to locate problems and take necessary actions to ensure effective traceability. In addition, more efficient use of recorded data provides an approach to enhance quality management. Data on ambient temperatures during logistics steps can be used to calculate the product warm up time. The results on temperature profiling pinpointed several hazardous steps in air transportation related to handling, storage and transport operations. Pros and cons of two transport modes, air vs. sea, were analysed. Several factors were found to influence product temperature and shelf life during logistics processes, namely, presence/absence of precooling, mode of transport, product location and logistics length. These findings help to improve logistics management as well as to make decisions on transport alternatives so as to improve quality management. The new photochromic time-temperature indicator (TTI) was found to give reproducible responses and reflect well the temperature conditions of fresh fish supply chains. The results show that a right charging time could be defined to suit the shelf life of the fresh fish product concerned. The TTI of a right charging level placed on the bottom surfaces of fresh cod retail packs was found to reflect well the temperature conditions of the product and the shelf life declared by sensory evaluation, except for the case of severely superchilled conditions, and other methods of quality control. The results indicate the potential of using the new TTI to continuously monitor product temperature history, quality and shelf life in fresh fish supply chains.},

Discarding is an undesirable practice, not only because of the waste of resources, but also because of its contribution to the overexploitation of fish stocks. Several countries have already established discard bans, to different extents (e.g., Norway, Iceland, Chile, New Zealand). The EU's landing obligation (discard ban) is a major measure of the latest reform of the Common Fisheries Policy for EU fisheries. It aims to reduce unwanted catches in EU fisheries, by incentivizing improved selectivity and restoring fish stocks to levels that can sustain the maximum production over time without harming the biodiversity and the capacity of future generations to obtain fish. However, banning discards will inevitably induce diverse short-and long-term ecological, economic, and social impacts, which may determine whether the landing obligation's objectives will be achieved.},

	abstract = {Fishery management is a complicated task that often results in overfishing, overcapacity, and low profits for the industry. The management of shared fish stocks is particularly problematic, especially if national authorities pursue different objectives. Multi-species fisheries add further complexity to the problem. It is no accident that management tools frequently used in Northern Europe, such as total allowable catches and individual quotas, are not applied in the Mediterranean Sea, where more target species are caught simultaneously. However, the European Commission intends to introduce a market-based driver for a strong, profitable fishing industry by phasing in transferable fishing concessions. This management approach is new for the Mediterranean, and it requires in-depth examination at institutional, legal, and economic levels. In this paper, after a review of the institutional setting, the economic perspective was analyzed by estimating the production function for the Italian small pelagic fishery in the Adriatic Sea. With the addition of Croatia to the European Union, the Adriatic Sea can become a Mediterranean communal exclusive fishing area. The results indicate that output measures such as total allowable catches and individual quotas should not cause serious discarding problems for this multi-species fishery.},

	abstract = {Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of “pretty good yield”, implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

Most fisheries are targeting multispecies and species are biologically and technically interacted each other. It enables a portfolio approach to be applied to find optimal production of each species through expected returns and risk analyses. Under specific assumptions on the harvest quota by species, efficient risk-return frontiers were generated and they showed a combination of optimal production level. Comparisons between portfolio and actual production provided a useful information for targeting strategy and management. Results also showed the possibility of effective multispecies fisheries management by imposing constraints on each species such as total allowable catch quotas.},

	abstract = {The case of fisheries management illustrates how the inherent structural instability of ecosystems can have deep-running policy implications. We contrast ten types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields (MSY) from multiple stocks and compare their effectiveness based on a management strategy evaluation (MSE) that uses complex food webs in its operating model. Plans that target specific stock sizes (\$B\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{MSY\}\}\$) consistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing pressures (\$F\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{MSY\}\}\$). A new self-optimising control rule, introduced here for its robustness to structural instability, led to intermediate yields. Most plans outperformed single-species management plans with pressure targets set without considering multispecies interactions. However, more refined plans to "maximise the yield from each stock separately", in the sense of a Nash equilibrium, produced total yields comparable to plans aiming to maximise total harvested biomass, and were more robust to structural instability. Our analyses highlight trade-offs between yields, amenability to negotiations, pressures on biodiversity, and continuity with current approaches in the European context. Based on these results, we recommend directions for developments of EU fisheries policy.},

	abstract = {Economists have long argued that a fishery that maximizes its economic potential usually will also satisfy its conservation objectives. Recently, maximum economic yield (MEY) has been identified as a primary management objective for Australian fisheries and is under consideration elsewhere. However, first attempts at estimating MEY as an actual management target for a real fishery (rather than a conceptual or theoretical exercise) have highlighted some substantial complexities generally unconsidered by fisheries economists. Here, we highlight some of the main issues encountered in our experience and their implications for estimating and transitioning to MEY. Using a bioeconomic model of an Australian fishery for which MEY is the management target, we note that unconstrained optimization may result in effort trajectories that would not be acceptable to industry or managers. Different assumptions regarding appropriate constraints result in different outcomes, each of which may be considered a valid MEY. Similarly, alternative treatments of prices and costs may result in differing estimates of MEY and their associated effort trajectories. To develop an implementable management strategy in an adaptive management framework, a set of assumptions must be agreed among scientists, economists, and industry and managers, indicating that operationalizing MEY is not simply a matter of estimating the numbers but requires strong industry commitment and involvement.},

In assessing broader consequences, the article examines patterns of adoption and certification effects that were not necessarily intended or anticipated.

This article assesses whether these assumptions hold through the analysis of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label for capture fisheries. It does so by examining how MSC has managed ‘supply’, ‘demand’ and ‘civic’ concerns in the market for sustainability certifications in capture fisheries. So far, MSC has been able to create and dominate the market for ‘sustainable fish’, but success has also been accompanied by serious challenges: first, MSC has so far failed to convincingly show that its certification system has positive environmental impacts; and second, it has marginalized Southern fisheries, especially in low-income countries. This has resulted in a peculiar configuration of the ‘sustainable fish market’, where we have a dearth of information on whether it is actually ‘sustainable’ and where a large majority of MSC-certified fish is captured in Northern fisheries, despite the fact that around half of total global exports of fish originate in the global South. As an institutional ‘solution’ to the global fishery crisis, MSC seems to be better tuned to the commercial interests of Northern fishing industries and retailers, and to a soft, market-based version of environmentalism – in other words, to the creation of a market for ‘sustainable fish’ rather than ‘sustainable fisheries’.},

	abstract = {Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.},

	abstract = {The fisheries sector significantly contributes to global food security, nutrition, and livelihood of people. Its importance for economic benefits, healthy diets, and nutrition, and achieving sustainable food systems is highlighted by several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), i.e., SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water). However, due to unprecedented population levels, the contribution of the fisheries sector to fulfills these roles is challenging, particularly given additional concerns regarding environmental well-being and sustainability. From this perspective, this study aims to identify the links and trade-offs between the development of this sector and the environmental sustainability in Thailand via a critical analysis of their trends, current ecological impacts, and more importantly, their contributions to several individual SDGs. A time-series of Thailand\&rsquo;s fisheries production from 1995 to 2015 indicates a recent reduction from around 3.0 million tons in 1995 to 1.5 million tons in 2015 of wild fish and shellfish from marine and freshwater habitats. The maximum sustainable yield of these species has been exceeded. Conversely, Thailand\&rsquo;s aquaculture production has continued to grow over the last decade, resulting in a reduction of mangrove forest area, wild fish stocks, and water quality. While capture fisheries and aquaculture production significantly contribute to several SDG targets, there are potential trade-offs between their development and the achievement of SDGs within the planet dimension, i.e., SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14, and SDG 15 (Life on Land). On the one hand, the mitigation of overfishing will be beneficial for the targets of SDG 14, leading to more sustainable resource management. On the other hand, it might cause a decrease in the volume of marine catches and economic and social profits. We conclude that the SDGs can serve as a framework for both policymakers and industrial workers to monitor and compromise on regulations that will optimize productivity in the context of sustainable development.},

It explores how this understanding may facilitate the transition to an “environment for well-being” approach to development through marine spatial planning (MSP), on the basis of emerging international guidance under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). By bringing marine ecosystem services and MSP into the discussion on SDG linkages, this article seeks to investigate the role of the ecosystem approach, and of fair and equitable benefit-sharing within it, in fostering participatory knowledge production, data-gathering and -sharing, mapping, strategic assessment and area-based management in the context of intensifying uses, multiple scales, needs and values around the marine environment. The article will assess to what extent MSP, building upon these tools and drawing on ecosystem services mapping, should be used to promote equity and prevent conflicts between stakeholders with contradictory demands for marine space and ecosystem services, with a view to enhancing synergies between SDG 14 and other SDGs.},

	abstract = {The marine areas of South America (SA) include almost 30,000 km of coastline and encompass three different oceanic domains--the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic--ranging in latitude from 12∘N to 55∘S. The 10 countries that border these coasts have different research capabilities and taxonomic traditions that affect taxonomic knowledge. This paper analyzes the status of knowledge of marine biodiversity in five subregions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America (SA): the Tropical East Pacific, the Humboldt Current,the Patagonian Shelf, the Brazilian Shelves, and the Tropical West Atlantic, and it provides a review of ecosystem threats and regional marine conservation strategies. South American marine biodiversity is least well known in the tropical subregions (with the exception of Costa Rica and Panama). Differences in total biodiversity were observed between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the same latitude. In the north of the continent, the Tropical East Pacific is richer in species than the Tropical West Atlantic, however, when standardized by coastal length, there is very little difference among them. In the south, the Humboldt Current system is much richer than the Patagonian Shelf. An analysis of endemism shows that 75\% of the species are reported within only one of the SA regions, while about 22\% of the species of SA are not reported elsewhere in the world. National and regional initiatives focusing on new exploration, especially to unknown areas and ecosystems, as well as collaboration among countries are fundamental to achieving the goal of completing inventories of species diversity and distribution.These inventories will allow accurate interpretation of the biogeography of its two oceanic coasts and latitudinal trends,and will also provide relevant information for science based policies.},

All three BRDs could be fitted to a shrimp trawl and normal fishing activities could be conducted both on an industrial trawler and an artisanal dhow boat. The comparisons of the catch from a net equipped with a BRD on one side and a standard net (exact same net configuration but without a BRD device) on the other side of a
double-rigged shrimp trawler (steel boat) showed different results in the three BRD types. The net fitted with a TED performed well without capturing any turtles or large animals, and did not significantly reduce shrimp catch or fish bycatch (124.4: 117.0 and 852.0: 905.8, both P {\textgreater} 0.05). Although the SMC reduced both shrimp catch and bycatch in general, the Wilcoxon’s signed rank test showed a significant difference only among bycatch (1034.2: 1147.3, P {\textless} 0.05). Chi-square tests showed that a net fitted with SMC caught significantly larger shrimp (more large and fewer small sizes) than a standard net for all three major shrimp species (33.5: 32.5; 26.9: 25.0; 20.3: 19.3, all P {\textless} 0.01). This indicates that the SMC reduced the catch of
small size shrimps as well as smaller size fish. A net fitted with a fisheye significantly reduced both the shrimp catch and bycatch (137.4: 174.6; 997.5: 1377.8, both P {\textless} 0.01); the shrimp loss was probably due to an inappropriate location of the FE in the trawl.},

	abstract = {The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) was created as a conservation tool – intended to provide ‘‘the best environmental choice in seafood’’ to consumers and to create positive incentives that would improve the status and management of ﬁsheries. During its 15 years, the MSC, which has an annual budget of close to US\$20 million, has attached its logo to more than 170 ﬁsheries. These certiﬁcations have not occurred without protest. Despite high costs and difﬁcult procedures, conservation organizations and other groups have ﬁled and paid for 19 formal objections to MSC ﬁsheries certiﬁcations. Only one objection has been upheld such that the ﬁshery was not certiﬁed. Here, we collate and summarize these objections and the major concerns as they relate to the MSC’s three main principles: sustainability of the target ﬁsh stock, low impacts on the ecosystem, and effective, responsive management. An analysis of the formal objections indicates that the MSC’s principles for sustainable ﬁshing are too lenient and discretionary, and allow for overly generous interpretation by third-party certiﬁers and adjudicators, which means that the MSC label may be misleading both consumers and conservation funders.},

	abstract = {This study presents a legal review of international treaties to derive sound definitions of overfishing. It examines seafood stocks that were certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or Friend of the Sea (FOS). Stock size and fishing pressure were compared with the internationally agreed reference points which both organizations have accepted. No suitable status information was found for 11\% (MSC) to 53\% (FOS) of the certified stocks. For the stocks with available status information, 19\% (FOS) to 31\% (MSC) had overfished stock sizes and were subject to ongoing overfishing. An analysis of legal implications of certification of overfished stocks suggests that a certifying body cannot be held liable for a violation of internationally agreed standards unless the domestic law of its home country so regulates. States may ban the import of fish products from overfished stocks, but only in very specific cases. Possible causes for the certification of overfished stocks are discussed and recommendations are given on how the certifiers could improve their performance. The study concludes that it is still reasonable to buy certified seafood, because the percentage of moderately exploited, healthy stocks is 3–4 times higher in certified than in non-certified seafood.},

	doi = {10.3354/meps08248},
	abstract = {Complex biogenic habitats formed by corals are important components of the megabenthos of seamounts, but their fragility makes them susceptible to damage by bottom trawling. Here we examine changes to stony corals and associated megabenthic assemblages on seamounts off Tasmania (Australia) with different histories of bottom-contact trawling by analysing 64 504 video frames (25 seamounts) and 704 high-resolution images (7 seamounts). Trawling had a dramatic impact on the seamount benthos: (1) bottom cover of the matrix-forming stony coral Solenosmilia variabilis was reduced by 2 orders of magnitude; (2) loss of coral habitat translated into 3-fold declines in richness, diversity and density of other megabenthos; and (3) megabenthos assemblage structures diverged widely between trawled and untrawled seamounts. On seamounts where trawling had been reduced to {\textless}5\% a decade ago and ceased completely 5 yr ago, there was no clear signal of recovery of the megabenthos; communities remained impoverished comprising fewer species at reduced densities. Differences in community structure in the trawled (as compared to the untrawled) seamounts were attributed to resistant species that survived initial impacts, others protected in natural refugia and early colonisers. Long-term persistence of trawling impacts on deep-water corals is consistent with their biological traits (e.g. slow growth rates, fragility) that make them particularly vulnerable. Because recovery on seamounts will be slow, the benefits from fishery closures may not be immediately recognisable or measureable. Spatial closures are crucial conservation instruments, but will require long-term commitments and expectations of performance whose time frames match the biological tempo in the deep sea.},

	abstract = {The 1976 U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act effectively eliminated the no-trawl zone known as the Bristol Bay Pot Sanctuary, located in the southeastern Bering Sea, Alaska. Implemented by the Japanese in 1959, the boundaries of the Pot Sanctuary closely matched the well-deﬁned distribution of the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) population’s mature-female brood stock, thus affording a measure of protection to the reproductive potential of the stock. In 1980, the point at which the commercial harvest of Bristol Bay legal-male red king crab reached an all-time high after a decade-long increase, domestic bottom trawling in the brood-stock sanctuary began in earnest with the advent of a U.S.–Soviet, joint-venture, yellowﬁn sole ﬁshery. In the ﬁrst year of trawling in the Pot Sanctuary, the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) red king crab bycatch increased by 371\% over the 1977–1979 average; in 1981 the BSAI bycatch increased another 235\% over that in 1980, most of which were mature females. As the number of unmonitored domestic trawls in the brood-stock area increased rapidly after 1979 and anecdotal reports of ‘‘red bags’’ (trawl cod-ends plugged with red king crab) began to circulate, the proportion of males in the mature population (0.25 in 1981 and 0.16 in 1982) jumped to 0.54 in 1985 and 0.65 in 1986. It is unlikely that normal demographics caused this sudden reversal in sex ratio. Our hypothesis is that sequential, sex-speciﬁc sources of ﬁshing mortality were at work. Initially there were ten years (1970–1980) of increasing, male-only exploitation in the directed pot ﬁshery, followed by a drastic reduction in the male harvest after 1980 (to zero in 1983). Then, beginning around 1980, there was an increase in bottom trawling among the highly aggregated, sexually mature female brood stock concentrated near the western end of the Alaska Peninsula, an area documented by previous investigators to be the most productive spawning, incubation, and hatching ground for Bristol Bay red king crab. There has been considerable discussion about possible natural causes (e.g., meteorological regime shifts, increased groundﬁsh predation, epizootic diseases) of the abrupt collapse of the Bristol Bay red king crab population in the early 1980s. The purpose of our study was to conduct a rigorous examination of existing data in order to evaluate the relative likelihood that the collapse was caused by human ﬁshing instead of natural mortality. Our discussion focuses on the association between record harvests of male crab in the directed ﬁshery, the onset of large-scale commercial trawling within the population’s primary reproductive refuge, and the population’s collapse.},

Estimates of annual bycatch were calculated based on bycatch rates and fishing effort information. Confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrap procedures. 185 taxa (January 2000 - June 2001), a bycatch to shrimp catch ratio of 16.6 (13.4 - 21.3, C.I. 95\%) and an annual bycatch estimation of 4538 t (4114 - 5122, C.I. 95\%) were computed in the northern fishing zone. In the southern fishing zone, 253 taxa (August 2004 - July 2005) were registered, a bycatch to shrimp catch ratio of 10.8 (9.8 - 11.8, C.I. 95\%) and an annual bycatch of 2507 t (2118 - 2980, I.C. 95\%) were estimated. Bycatch to shrimp catch ratios ranked among the highest in the world. Proliferation of benthic scavengers (Portunidae) could be attributed to the high levels of discards. Species contributing to habitat structure, like sponges, shown high catch rates. In summary, the results suggest a deteriorate condition in the ecosystem and stress the urgent need of mitigation measures if we are to maintain its functioning.},

To reduce this by-catch, the fishery for Atlantic seabob shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri in Suriname uses nets fitted Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and By-catch Reduction Devices (BRDs). It is unclear, however, to what extend these selectivity measures, designed to reduce capture of marine turtles and small roundfish respectively, are reducing by-catch of rays. Due to their life-history characteristics, rays (Batoidea; Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are generally vulnerable to overexploitation and several endangered species are known to occur in Surinamese waters. The objective of this study therefore is to assess the effect of the selectivity devices currently in place (TEDs and BRDs) on ray by-catch in the X. kroyeri trawling fishery. Hereto, sixty-five simultaneous catch-comparison hauls were conducted, comparing ray by-catch in trawls fitted with (test-net) and withou},

	abstract = {Data from a monitored segment (about 20 vessels) of the fleet of about 6000 small vessels (less than 15 meters length overall) operating bottom-set gillnets for cod (Gadus morhua) and monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) in the Norwegian coastal zone were used to estimate the bycatch rates of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Bycatch was estimated using the traditional stratified ratio technique and a GLM-based approach. Bycatch rates were then applied to the landing statistics for the target species for the whole fleet to estimate total bycatch. The stratified ratio estimates ranged from 2211 (CV 0.16) to 3218 (CV 0.17) harbour porpoises, 459 (CV 0.24) to 565 (CV 0.18) harbour seals and 68 (CV 0.27) to 128 (CV 0.41) grey seals. In the model-based approaches, estimates ranged from 2317 (CV 0.16) to 3218 (CV 0.17) harbour porpoises, 424 (CV 0.13) to 600 (CV 0.31) harbour seals and 83 (CV 0.36) grey seals. There were difficulties fitting the models, and the design-based estimators might be considered “best”. Unless the population of harbour porpoise along the Norwegian coast exceeds 176,500 animals, then current levels of harbour porpoise bycatch are unsustainable. Current levels of harbour seal bycatch (coupled with current hunting quotas) are most likely unsustainable. Estimates for grey seal bycatch based on CRF data were not considered reliable, because of insufficient data and the possibility of seal misidentification.},

	abstract = {The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) is widely regarded as the best way to manage our living marine resources. While traditional fisheries management focuses on the populations of the target species, an EAF recognizes the complexity of ecosystems in which fisheries operate. Crucial aspects of an EAF are therefore (1) trophic relations between target species, their prey and predators, (2) indirect interactions between fleets - through trophic links and bycatch - and (3) the impact of fishing on marine habitats and species communities. Ignoring these elements in fisheries management lies at the core of different environmental and socio-economic problems, particularly in tropical shrimp fisheries. Triggered by a negative public perception and increasing consumer demand for sustainable products, the fishery for seabob shrimp in Suriname launched a sustainability initiative, resulting in certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). This eco-label, however, was not an endpoint, but formed the basis for further improvements and was the direct motivation for this doctoral study. In cooperation with the local fisheries administration, the fishing industry, NGOs and the local university, research was conducted on the coastal ecosystem in Suriname, until recently virtually a blind spot for marine biologists. First, we investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of fish and invertebrates in the coastal waters. A second important element was the characterization of the role of seabob shrimp in the marine food web. Thirdly, this study focused on assessing the impact of seabob fisheries on the coastal ecosystem, by examining the composition of commercial catches. The scientific results were translated into recommendations to further support an ecosystem approach to the management of the Suriname seabob fishery. This thesis shows that fisheries can be sustainably managed, even those targeting tropical shrimp. Eco-labelling, participatory management and research can play a crucial role in this process.},

We tested the performance of a Bycatch Reduction Device, the Yarrow Fisheye, during two periods of commercial fishing operations in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery, by comparing the catches of paired treatment and control nets. We compared the catch weights of the small fish and invertebrate bycatch, and the commercially important tiger prawns, from 42 trawls in 2002. The Yarrow Fisheye reduced the weight of small bycatch by a mean of 22.7\%, with no loss of tiger prawn. We also compared the numbers of seasnakes caught in 41 and 72 trawls during the spring trawling seasons of 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Yarrow Fisheye reduced the catches by a mean of 43.3\%. Flume-tank tests of the Yarrow Fisheye showed that this device created a slow water-flow region extending over 2m downstream from its position in the net, and close to where the catch accumulates. Finfish and seasnakes may be exploiting this slow water-flow region to escape via the eye. Although the reductions in fish and seasnake bycatch were excellent, we think they could be further improved by relating differences in fisheye position and localised water displacements, to design and rigging changes.},

	abstract = {Assessments of incidental wildlife mortality resulting from fishing rarely account for unobserved by-catch. We assessed by-catch of protected and vulnerable wildlife species in an Australian trawl fishery by comparing in-trawl video footage with data collected by an on-board observer. Data were obtained from 44 commercial trawls with two different by-catch reduction devices (BRDs). Eighty-six individuals from six major taxa (dolphins, sharks, rays, sea snakes, turtles and sygnathids) were documented from video analysis, including the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) and the critically endangered green sawfish (Pristis zijsron). On the basis of the 2008–2009 fishing effort of 4149 trawls and scaling from these results, we estimated the annual catch of protected and vulnerable species (± �1 s.e.) at 8109 ± �910 individuals. Only 34\% of by-catch was expelled through the BRDs. Independent observer data for the 44 trawls showed that 77\% of the landed by-catch from these taxa were dead when discarded. The results indicate that unaccounted by-catch in trawl fisheries can be substantial, and that current methods of recording by-catch on-board vessels are likely to underestimate total fishing mortality. We recommend gear modifications and their validation through dedicated observer coverage, combined with in-trawl video camera deployments to improve current approaches to by-catch mitigation.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of collective action and the origin of collective action problems have been extensively and systematically studied in the social sciences. Yet, while we have substantial knowledge about the factors promoting collective action at the local level, we know far less about how these insights travel to large-scale collective action problems. Such problems, however, are at the heart of humanity’s most pressing challenges, including climate change, large-scale natural resource depletion, biodiversity loss, nuclear proliferation, antibiotic resistance due to overconsumption of antibiotics, and pollution. In this paper, we suggest an analytical framework that captures the theoretical understanding of preconditions for large-scale collective action. This analytical framework aims at supporting future empirical analyses of how to cope with and overcome larger-scale collective action problems. More specifically, we (i) define and describe the main characteristics of a large-scale collective action problem and (ii) explain why voluntary and, in particular, spontaneous large-scale collective action among individual actors becomes more improbable as the collective action problem becomes larger, thus demanding interventions by an external authority (a third party) for such action to be generated. Based on this, we (iii) outline an analytical framework that illustrates the connection between third-party interventions and large-scale collective action. We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research.},

Goals of the review were to evaluate the state of knowledge of bycatch and the role of existing protective legislation in shaping bycatch management for different taxa. Pressing issues are identified, as well as knowledge gaps and policy limitations that hinder multi-species bycatch reduction. The USA has made important progress toward reducing bycatch in its fisheries, but the efficacy of its management has been limited somewhat by a focus on taxon- and fishery-specific regulation and the lack of consistent mandate across taxa for taking a cumulative perspective on bycatch. Applying consistent criteria across taxa for setting bycatch limits (e.g., extending the approach used for marine mammals to sea turtles and seabirds) would be the first step in a multi-species approach to bycatch reduction. A population-based multi-species multi-gear approach to bycatch would help identify priority areas where resources are needed most and can be used most effectively.},

Compared with a conventional codend, catches from a codend made entirely of square meshes showed a 52\% reduction in the mean weight of prawns caught and a 95\% reduction in the numbers of mulloway caught. A codend with the posterior half made of diamond-shaped meshes and the anterior half made of square-shaped meshes showed no significant difference in the catches of prawns compared with the control, but reduced to 46\% the mean numbers of mulloway caught. There were no differences in the sizes of prawns and mulloway caught by the half-square and the control codends. The codend made of all square meshes did not catch the smallest prawns and mulloway available. The results are discussed in terms of the probable behaviour of prawns and mulloway in trawls and the possibilities for future developments of these fishing gears. It was concluded that there is a great potential for square-mesh panels in codends to reduce the by-catch of fish such as juvenile mulloway in the Hawkesbury River prawn-trawl fishery while maintaining catches of prawns.},

	abstract = {Two experiments were done in the oceanic penaeid prawn-trawl fishery in New South Wales to investigate (i) the optimal positioning of behavioural-type by-catch reduction devices (BRDs) involving square-mesh panels; and (ii) the relative performances of two industry-developed square-mesh panels against a composite square-mesh panel developed by scientists. In the first experiment, three codends, each containing one square-mesh panel (located on the tops of the codend at distances of 0.7, 1.2 and 1.6 m anterior to the last row of meshes respectively) significantly reduced the catches of some small fish and total discards compared with a control codend that held no BRD. Rates of reduction significantly increased with proximity of the square-mesh panel to the end of the codend. There was, however, a significant reduction in catches of prawns from the codend containing the square-mesh panel at 0.7 m. Based on these results, the optimal position for these sorts of BRDs was determined to be at 1.2 m anterior to the last row of meshes. In the second experiment, at this position, two codends containing industry-developed plastic and metal square-mesh panels were less effective in excluding by-catch than a codend containing the composite square-mesh panel. The results are discussed in terms of species-specific differences in behavioural responses and swimming ability and the future development and testing of behavioural-type BRDs in penaeid prawn trawls.},

Moreover, the marked seasonal and interannual variabilities play important roles in the stability or fluctuations in the environmental parameters that influence biodiversity at the ecological, population, and genetic levels. Previous and ongoing studies of the marine and littoral biota relate mostly to commercial marine species, protected species in danger of extinction and, specially, to the biodiversity and functioning of local coastal and littoral ecosystems such as estuaries, mudflats, sandy beaches and, particularly, littoral mangroves. A more integrated approach involving local, regional, and international scientific collaboration is needed for a better assessment and understanding of marine biodiversity. Such studies would benefit from international cooperation that would allow the gathering of new information and the comparison of previous data, the organization of common oceanographic surveys, the homogenisation of analytical protocols, and also favour the exchange of scientists and postgraduate students for a real transfer of ideas, techniques, and know-how. Moreover, research on the comparative biodiversity of analogous littoral and marine ecosystems in different parts of South America would allow a more accurate estimate of marine biodiversity on a continental scale.},

	abstract = {The coastal development of the Guianas is dominated by extensive, shoreface-attached and alongshore westward migrating mudbanks. The behaviour of these mudbanks is mainly determined by a combination of the large supply of Amazon-borne silt and clay and the trade wind generated wave action. In the front zone of the mudbanks, fluid mud is formed. As a result, the incoming waves are strongly attenuated and deposition is favoured. At their rear side, compacted clay deposits are eroded by waves. The mudbanks, migrating in this manner, are the driving mechanism in the development of the smallest coastal unit, which consists of a mudbank and the eastward adjacent interbank area. Eisma et al. [Neth. J. Sea Res. 28 (1991) 181] has demonstrated that the frequency of the northeast trade wind, which blows towards the coast of the Guianas, in the windy season (January till April), shows a systematic change in time. For the period 1953–1986, there is evidence that the frequency of winds coming from directions between 50° and 80° (roughly east–northeast) increases. The same applies to the wind velocity from that direction. In the last 10 years a reversal of these trends appears to occur. For a more or less east–west directed coastal section, e.g. the coastline of Suriname, a more easterly direction of the northeast trade wind results in an increased longshore wave energy flux in the coastal waters. This causes an increase in length of the mudbanks, at the detriment of the usually eroding interbank parts of the coast. This is evidenced by the large-scale coastal development during the related period, demonstrating an increasing length of the mudbanks and consequently an increasing net accretion. It is hypothesised that this development will reverse if the new trends in wind direction and velocity develop further. At the geological scale, it is considered that a coincidence of a systematic increase of more northerly directed wind frequencies and a fall in sea level are responsible for the two erosive interruptions in the generally accreting coastal plain during the Young Holocene Period.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new, open-source modelling software entitled ‘Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment’ (JABBA). JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billﬁshes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, ﬂexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Speciﬁc emphasis has been placed on ﬂexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically ﬁtting multiple catch per unit eﬀort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or PellaTomlinson production functions; 4) options to ﬁx or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model ﬁt diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordﬁsh (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modiﬁed by the global scientiﬁc community.},
